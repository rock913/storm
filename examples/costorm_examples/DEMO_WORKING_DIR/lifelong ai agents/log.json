AI-driven discoveries and technologies are transforming Americans' daily lives — promising practical solutions to global challenges, from food production and climate change to healthcare and education.\n[2]: Artificial intelligence (AI) has many applications in various aspects of our daily life, including health, criminal, education, civil, business, and liability law. One aspect of AI that has gained significant attention is natural language processing (NLP), which refers to the ability of computers to understand and generate human language. This study aims to examine the potential for, and concerns of, using AI in scientific research. For this purpose, high-impact research articles were generated by analyzing the quality of reports generated by ChatGPT and assessing the application’s impact on the research framework, data analysis, and the literature review.\n[3]: The aim of this paper is to provide a broad research guideline on fundamental sciences with potential infusion of AI, to help motivate researchers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art applications of AI-based fundamental sciences, and thereby to help promote the continuous development of these fundamental sciences. ... No articles found.\n[4]: ChatGPT demonstrates significant potential in academic writing, though challenges in academic integrity and AI-human balance persist. ... AI is transforming academic practices, necessitating broader integration and ethical use in research.\n[5]: AI tools for research can help you to discover new sources for your literature review or research assignment. These tools will synthesize information from large databases of scholarly output with the aim of finding the most relevant articles and saving researchers' time.\n[6]: Prompt “write me a paragraph about the impact of climate change on GDP with citations“  ... Integrated with Research Solutions. Over 1.2 billion Citation Statements and metadata from over 181 million papers suggested reference. How does it work? - \"scite uses access to full-text articles and its deep learning model to tell you, for a given publication: - how many times it was cited by others - how it was cited by others by displaying the text where the citation happened from each citing paper - whether each citation offers supporting or contrasting evidence of the cited claims in the publication of interest, or simply mention it.\"\n[7]: Start your submission and get more impact for your research by publishing with us.\n[8]: Nature - As artificially intelligent tools for literature and data exploration evolve, developers seek to automate how hypotheses are generated and validated.\n[9]: This study addresses this concern, by conducting a systematic literature review of AI research in IS between 2005 and 2020. The search strategy resulted in 1877 studies, of which 98 were identified as primary studies and a synthesise of key themes that are pertinent to this study is presented.\n[10]: Generally, a paper should include a convincing motivational discussion, articulate the relevance of the research to Artificial Intelligence, clarify what is new and different, anticipate the scientific impact of the work, include all relevant proofs and/or experimental data, and provide a thorough discussion of connections with the existing literature. A prerequisite for the novelty of a paper is that the results it describes have not been previously published by other authors and have not been previously published by the same authors in any archival journal. In particular, a previous conference publication by the same authors does not disqualify a submission on the grounds of novelty.\n[11]: The study provides an insightful agenda for the future based on evidence-based research directions that would benefit future AI scholars to identify contemporary research issues and develop impactful research to solve complex societal problems. ... No data was used for the research described in the article.\n[12]: These agents use large language models and generative models to feature structured memory for continual learning and use machine learning tools to incorporate scientific knowledge, biological principles, and theories. AI agents can impact areas ranging from virtual cell simulation, programmable control of phenotypes, and the design of cellular circuits to developing new therapies. ... No articles found.\n[13]: A paper posted to the preprint server arXiv.org in August outlined an “AI Scientist” agent capable of formulating new research ideas and testing them through experimentation—effectively automating the scientific method. Despite the close ontological associations between agency and consciousness, there’s no reason to believe that, in machines, advances in the former will lead to the latter. Tech companies certainly aren’t advertising these tools as having anything close to free will. It is possible users might treat agentic AI as if it were sentient—but that would reflect, more than anything else, the millions of years of evolution that have hardwired people’s brain to attribute consciousness to anything that seems human.\n[14]: With regards to the autonomous exploration goal, we see agent frameworks leverage curriculum learning to identify suitable tasks and LLMs as goal generators. The most interesting example of this is Voyager, an embodied lifelong learning agent in Minecraft.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational and concise\n\nNow give your response.

                "content": "The balance between foundational research and practical applications in the realm of lifelong AI agents is evolving rapidly, driven by advancements in both AI technologies and methodologies. Foundational research, supported by entities like the U.S. National Science Foundation since the 1960s, has laid the groundwork for the transformative applications we see today across various sectors, including healthcare, education, and climate change [1][2]. As these foundational insights continue to inform practical applications, we are witnessing an increased focus on how AI tools can enhance research practices, especially in data exploration and hypothesis generation [8].\n\nLifelong AI agents, characterized by their capacity for continual learning and structured memory, represent a significant leap in applying AI to complex problem-solving. These agents utilize large language models and machine learning techniques to assimilate and apply scientific knowledge effectively, facilitating advancements in diverse areas such as virtual cell simulation and therapy development [12]. The development of AI systems that can autonomously generate and validate research hypotheses—like the \"AI Scientist\"—illustrates a blend of foundational research with practical utility, reflecting a trend toward automation in the scientific method [13].\n\nThis evolution is likely to influence publication strategies moving forward. As AI tools become integral to literature reviews and research synthesis, researchers may prioritize submissions that not only present novel findings but also demonstrate how these findings are enhanced through AI applications [4][5]. Furthermore, the challenges associated with academic integrity and the ethical use of AI underscore the need for clear guidelines in research publication, ensuring that the contributions of AI are both recognized and appropriately contextualized [4].\n\nIn summary, the interplay between foundational research and practical applications is likely to shape future publication strategies, driving a more integrated approach that emphasizes both innovation in AI and its implications for real-world problem-solving. However, as the landscape evolves, ongoing discussions about ethical considerations and the responsible use of AI in research will remain critical.",

How does it work? - \\\"scite uses access to full-text articles and its deep learning model to tell you, for a given publication: - how many times it was cited by others - how it was cited by others by displaying the text where the citation happened from each citing paper - whether each citation offers supporting or contrasting evidence of the cited claims in the publication of interest, or simply mention it.\\\"\\n[7]: Start your submission and get more impact for your research by publishing with us.\\n[8]: Nature - As artificially intelligent tools for literature and data exploration evolve, developers seek to automate how hypotheses are generated and validated.\\n[9]: This study addresses this concern, by conducting a systematic literature review of AI research in IS between 2005 and 2020. The search strategy resulted in 1877 studies, of which 98 were identified as primary studies and a synthesise of key themes that are pertinent to this study is presented.\\n[10]: Generally, a paper should include a convincing motivational discussion, articulate the relevance of the research to Artificial Intelligence, clarify what is new and different, anticipate the scientific impact of the work, include all relevant proofs and/or experimental data, and provide a thorough discussion of connections with the existing literature. A prerequisite for the novelty of a paper is that the results it describes have not been previously published by other authors and have not been previously published by the same authors in any archival journal. In particular, a previous conference publication by the same authors does not disqualify a submission on the grounds of novelty.\\n[11]: The study provides an insightful agenda for the future based on evidence-based research directions that would benefit future AI scholars to identify contemporary research issues and develop impactful research to solve complex societal problems. ... No data was used for the research described in the article.\\n[12]: These agents use large language models and generative models to feature structured memory for continual learning and use machine learning tools to incorporate scientific knowledge, biological principles, and theories. AI agents can impact areas ranging from virtual cell simulation, programmable control of phenotypes, and the design of cellular circuits to developing new therapies. ... No articles found.\\n[13]: A paper posted to the preprint server arXiv.org in August outlined an \\u201cAI Scientist\\u201d agent capable of formulating new research ideas and testing them through experimentation\\u2014effectively automating the scientific method. Despite the close ontological associations between agency and consciousness, there\\u2019s no reason to believe that, in machines, advances in the former will lead to the latter. Tech companies certainly aren\\u2019t advertising these tools as having anything close to free will. It is possible users might treat agentic AI as if it were sentient\\u2014but that would reflect, more than anything else, the millions of years of evolution that have hardwired people\\u2019s brain to attribute consciousness to anything that seems human.\\n[14]: With regards to the autonomous exploration goal, we see agent frameworks leverage curriculum learning to identify suitable tasks and LLMs as goal generators.

The push for interdisciplinary teamwork, particularly between AI specialists and experts from diverse domains, has led to a burgeoning interest in how AI can transform research practices[53]. \n\nHowever, challenges remain in fully realizing the benefits of AI in interdisciplinary research. Future AI development must not only impact scientific domains but also draw inspiration from them, ensuring a two-way flow of knowledge[52]. Additionally, ethical considerations, such as decision explainability and transparency regarding dataset biases, are essential to maintaining the integrity of interdisciplinary collaborations[51]. Establishing regulatory frameworks and evaluation methodologies will be critical in fostering responsible AI research[52].\n\nAI education is also an important factor in promoting interdisciplinary innovation. Greater emphasis on teaching AI concepts within various scientific and educational communities can empower more researchers to leverage AI tools effectively, thus enhancing collaborative efforts[51][52]. Moreover, AI applications in research, such as natural language processing, have the potential to streamline literature reviews and synthesize information from extensive databases, further supporting interdisciplinary work by saving researchers valuable time[66][68]. \n\nOverall, the integration of lifelong AI agents in research not only holds promise for advancing scientific discovery but also necessitates a concerted effort to address ethical and practical challenges to maximize their potential in fostering interdisciplinary collaboration[65][67].",

These advancements enable AI agents to incorporate scientific knowledge, biological principles, and theories, impacting a variety of fields including virtual cell simulation, programmable control of phenotypes, and the design of cellular circuits, as well as the development of new therapies[70]. \n\nA notable development in this field is the emergence of the “AI Scientist” agent, which was outlined in a paper on the preprint server arXiv.org in August. This agent is capable of formulating new research ideas and testing them through experimentation, effectively automating the scientific method[71]. While there is an ontological association between agency and consciousness, it is important to recognize that advancements in agency do not imply the presence of consciousness in machines. Current tech companies do not market these tools as having free will, and any attribution of sentience by users likely stems from evolutionary tendencies to ascribe human-like qualities to non-human entities[71]. \n\nAs research continues to advance, the balance between foundational research and practical applications is likely to influence publication strategies in the field of lifelong AI agents, as researchers seek to highlight both the theoretical underpinnings and the real-world implications of their work[70][71].",
