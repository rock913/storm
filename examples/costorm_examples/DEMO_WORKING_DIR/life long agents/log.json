Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of travel, science fiction, and utopian novels.\n[2]: But even if a potential anti-geric compound appears in animal models to postpone or decelerate aging when administered to middle-aged volunteers, documentation that it has an effect on longevity or late-life illnesses in humans is, at minimum, a 20-year exercise, and an expensive one with no certainty of success. We do not know how to measure aging. Research on medicines to help hypertensives depended heavily on the invention of a device to measure blood pressure. Research on antipyretics requires a thermometer, and research on antiobesity agents requires a scale.\n[3]: While agents such as these have some limited laboratory evidence of efficacy in animals, there are no studies to date in humans for drugs that may promote life extension, mainly because research investment remains at a low level, and regulatory standards are high.\n[4]: One systemic definition of life is that living things are self-organizing and autopoietic (self-producing). Variations of this include Stuart Kauffman's definition as an autonomous agent or a multi-agent system capable of reproducing itself, and of completing at least one thermodynamic work cycle.\n[5]: Medical imaging – Medical imaging is the technique and process used to create images of the human body (or parts and function thereof) for clinical or physiological research purposes · Immunotherapy – is the \"treatment of disease by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response\". Immunotherapies designed to elicit or amplify an immune response are classified as activation immunotherapies, while immunotherapies that reduce or suppress are classified as suppression immunotherapies. Kinesiology – Kinesiology, also known as human kinetics, is the scientific study of human movement.\n[6]: Breakthroughs in the study of longevity—why humans age, how they age, and interventions to slow the aging process—are fueling the possibility that humans may surpass existing life expectancies and live into their 140s. We are beginning to see a paradigm shift from disease-focused treatments to those that address the underlying mechanisms of aging, biological systems, and wellness. In fact, a growing community of scientific researchers believe they have the tools to extend healthy human life, transforming health care as we know it today.\n[7]: In 2013, Google announced Calico, a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging. It is led by Arthur D. Levinson, and its research team includes scientists such as Hal V. Barron, David Botstein, and Cynthia Kenyon. In 2014, biologist Craig Venter founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy.\n[8]: Most people want to live a long and happy life – or at least avoid a short and miserable one. If you’re in that majority, then you’re in luck. Over the last decade, a quiet research revolution has occurred in our understanding of the biology of ageing. The challenge is to turn this knowledge into advice and treatments we can benefit from. Here we bust the myth that lengthening healthy life expectancy is science fiction, and show that it is instead scientific fact.\n[9]: \"They are asking the question of 'What's the longest life that could be lived by a human complex system if everything else went really well, and it's in a stressor-free environment?'\" says Heather Whitson, director of the Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development, who was not involved in the paper. The team's results point to an underlying \"pace of aging\" that sets the limits on life span, she says.

The complete version history of this preprint is available at bioRxiv. Evidence that life-extending interventions are not uniformly effective across the lifespan calls for an analytic tool that can estimate age-specific treatment effects on mortality hazards. Here we report such a tool, applying it to mouse data from 42 agents tested in the NIA Interventions Testing Program.\n[11]: Systems that operate on behalf of people or corporations are the latest product from the AI boom, but these “agents” may present new and unpredictable risks ... All day, every day, you make choices. Philosophers have long argued that this ability to act intentionally, or with agency, distinguishes human beings from simpler life-forms and machines.\n[12]: These agents use large language models and generative models to feature structured memory for continual learning and use machine learning tools to incorporate scientific knowledge, biological principles, and theories. AI agents can impact areas ranging from virtual cell simulation, programmable control of phenotypes, and the design of cellular circuits to developing new therapies. ... No articles found.\n[13]: The promising capabilities of senotherapeutics to improve health and contribute to the substantial extension of healthy lifespan have already been reported, even if the results currently available showing the effects of these drugs were obtained from preclinical animal studies, which raise legitimate concerns about a potential underestimation of the side effects resulting from a long-term use and chronic administrations. Regarding senomorphics agents, the molecular identification of SASP factors with a detailed characterization of the different pathways responsible for the expected outcomes may enable future interventions in different tissues (Lagoumtzi and Niki, 2021).\n[14]: OpenAI’s latest reasoning model, o1, has demonstrated potential in scientific text analysis, accelerating literature reviews and hypothesis generation. It also is capable of math unlike most large language models. Beyond these headline-grabbing advances, AI agents are gradually finding use in research labs, automating experiments and analyzing complex datasets.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\n\nNow give your response.

                "content": "Lifelong agents are an intriguing concept that blends insights from diverse fields such as longevity research, artificial intelligence, and biological sciences. The core idea revolves around creating agents or systems that not only persist over extended periods but also evolve and adapt in response to their environments, much like living organisms. These agents are envisioned to harness technologies aimed at understanding and potentially extending human longevity.\n\nIn the realm of human life extension, longevity studies have been a focus of both scientific inquiry and popular imagination for centuries, often featuring in science fiction and utopian narratives[1]. Despite promising initial results in laboratory settings, particularly with animal models, translating these findings to humans remains a complex challenge. Current research endeavors in life extension are extensive and resource-intensive, with some predicting it could take decades before we see significant breakthroughs applicable to human health[2][3]. The study of longevity has started shifting focus from traditional disease treatment to addressing the underlying mechanisms of aging itself, promising potential advancements in extending healthy human lifespans[6].\n\nParallel to biological endeavors, AI has contributed significantly to the concept of lifelong agents. Artificial intelligence systems, particularly those using large language models and machine learning, are being developed to learn continuously and autonomously, simulating a form of artificial life. These systems can adapt and apply scientific and biological knowledge to various domains, including healthcare, which might eventually influence how we approach aging and longevity[12]. AI agents are also playing a role in scientific research, automating processes, and analyzing vast amounts of data to expedite discoveries[14].\n\nIn terms of potential therapies, senotherapeutics and senomorphic agents are showing promise. These are compounds aimed at improving health and possibly extending lifespan by targeting the biological processes associated with aging[13]. However, much of the existing data comes from preclinical animal studies, highlighting the need for further research to address possible side effects and refine these approaches for human application.\n\nWhile the quest for life extension continues, it's important to acknowledge the inherent uncertainties and challenges, including the rigorous scientific and regulatory hurdles that must be overcome[3]. Nonetheless, the ongoing interdisciplinary research efforts hold promise for transforming our understanding of aging and potentially reshaping the future of healthcare[6][8].",

Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of travel, science fiction, and utopian novels.\\n[2]: But even if a potential anti-geric compound appears in animal models to postpone or decelerate aging when administered to middle-aged volunteers, documentation that it has an effect on longevity or late-life illnesses in humans is, at minimum, a 20-year exercise, and an expensive one with no certainty of success. We do not know how to measure aging. Research on medicines to help hypertensives depended heavily on the invention of a device to measure blood pressure. Research on antipyretics requires a thermometer, and research on antiobesity agents requires a scale.\\n[3]: While agents such as these have some limited laboratory evidence of efficacy in animals, there are no studies to date in humans for drugs that may promote life extension, mainly because research investment remains at a low level, and regulatory standards are high.\\n[4]: One systemic definition of life is that living things are self-organizing and autopoietic (self-producing). Variations of this include Stuart Kauffman's definition as an autonomous agent or a multi-agent system capable of reproducing itself, and of completing at least one thermodynamic work cycle.\\n[5]: Medical imaging \\u2013 Medical imaging is the technique and process used to create images of the human body (or parts and function thereof) for clinical or physiological research purposes \\u00b7 Immunotherapy \\u2013 is the \\\"treatment of disease by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response\\\". Immunotherapies designed to elicit or amplify an immune response are classified as activation immunotherapies, while immunotherapies that reduce or suppress are classified as suppression immunotherapies. Kinesiology \\u2013 Kinesiology, also known as human kinetics, is the scientific study of human movement.\\n[6]: Breakthroughs in the study of longevity\\u2014why humans age, how they age, and interventions to slow the aging process\\u2014are fueling the possibility that humans may surpass existing life expectancies and live into their 140s. We are beginning to see a paradigm shift from disease-focused treatments to those that address the underlying mechanisms of aging, biological systems, and wellness. In fact, a growing community of scientific researchers believe they have the tools to extend healthy human life, transforming health care as we know it today.\\n[7]: In 2013, Google announced Calico, a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging. It is led by Arthur D. Levinson, and its research team includes scientists such as Hal V. Barron, David Botstein, and Cynthia Kenyon. In 2014, biologist Craig Venter founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy.\\n[8]: Most people want to live a long and happy life \\u2013 or at least avoid a short and miserable one. If you\\u2019re in that majority, then you\\u2019re in luck. Over the last decade, a quiet research revolution has occurred in our understanding of the biology of ageing. The challenge is to turn this knowledge into advice and treatments we can benefit from. Here we bust the myth that lengthening healthy life expectancy is science fiction, and show that it is instead scientific fact.\\n[9]: \\\"They are asking the question of 'What's the longest life that could be lived by a human complex system if everything else went really well, and it's in a stressor-free environment?'\\\" says Heather Whitson, director of the Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development, who was not involved in the paper. The team's results point to an underlying \\\"pace of aging\\\" that sets the limits on life span, she says.

The complete version history of this preprint is available at bioRxiv. Evidence that life-extending interventions are not uniformly effective across the lifespan calls for an analytic tool that can estimate age-specific treatment effects on mortality hazards. Here we report such a tool, applying it to mouse data from 42 agents tested in the NIA Interventions Testing Program.\\n[11]: Systems that operate on behalf of people or corporations are the latest product from the AI boom, but these \\u201cagents\\u201d may present new and unpredictable risks ... All day, every day, you make choices. Philosophers have long argued that this ability to act intentionally, or with agency, distinguishes human beings from simpler life-forms and machines.\\n[12]: These agents use large language models and generative models to feature structured memory for continual learning and use machine learning tools to incorporate scientific knowledge, biological principles, and theories. AI agents can impact areas ranging from virtual cell simulation, programmable control of phenotypes, and the design of cellular circuits to developing new therapies. ... No articles found.\\n[13]: The promising capabilities of senotherapeutics to improve health and contribute to the substantial extension of healthy lifespan have already been reported, even if the results currently available showing the effects of these drugs were obtained from preclinical animal studies, which raise legitimate concerns about a potential underestimation of the side effects resulting from a long-term use and chronic administrations. Regarding senomorphics agents, the molecular identification of SASP factors with a detailed characterization of the different pathways responsible for the expected outcomes may enable future interventions in different tissues (Lagoumtzi and Niki, 2021).\\n[14]: OpenAI\\u2019s latest reasoning model, o1, has demonstrated potential in scientific text analysis, accelerating literature reviews and hypothesis generation. It also is capable of math unlike most large language models. Beyond these headline-grabbing advances, AI agents are gradually finding use in research labs, automating experiments and analyzing complex datasets.\\n\\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\\n\\nNow give your response.

At least three research groups are now conducting studies designed to determine whether CR will retard aging in a nonhuman primate, the rhesus monkey. The data, though incomplete, so far look fairly promising.\n[3]: Jun 11, 2024 - Explore the potential of life extension treatments, with a focus on the role of mesenchymal stem cells in anti-aging research. This comprehensive guide delves into the science, benefits, controversies, and future of life extension, providing a balanced view of this rapidly evolving field.\n[4]: Even the most promising ones are “in the box of ‘maybe,’” Kaeberlein said. About a dozen already approved drugs ‒ including rapamycin, used to prevent organ rejection in transplantation, and the diabetes drug metformin ‒ might be repurposed to help expand healthy lifespan, said Dr. Nir Barzilai, the founding director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.\n[5]: In the twentieth century, human life expectancy rose dramatically. Based on the past three decades of observed mortality in the eight countries with the longest-lived populations and in Hong Kong and the United States, Olshansky et al. propose that, without medical breakthroughs that slow aging, radical lifespan extension is implausible in this century.\n[6]: Because these pathways are \"conserved,\" meaning that they have been passed down to humans through evolution, they have been the subject of intensive research. A number of drugs that extend healthy lifespan by altering these pathways are now under development. The discovery of the synergistic effect opens the door to even more effective anti-aging therapies.\n[7]: During aging, these tags are rearranged, disappearing from some sites, appearing at others. Evidence has now accumulated that the overall pattern of these tags across the entire genome does indeed reliably indicate biological age in nearly any mammal species, including humans.

                "content": "The field of biological aging has been buzzing with exciting developments that could pave the way for therapies aimed at extending healthy human lifespans. One of the most promising areas is tissue rejuvenation and regenerative medicine. Researchers and life extension enthusiasts anticipate that breakthroughs in stem cells and molecular repair could enable complete rejuvenation to a youthful state, which is often referred to as agerasia [1].\n\nThe potential of mesenchymal stem cells in anti-aging research is a particularly hot topic. These cells are being explored for their ability to repair and rejuvenate aging tissues, offering a glimpse into future life extension treatments [3]. In parallel, efforts are being made to repurpose existing drugs like rapamycin and metformin. These drugs, originally developed for other medical purposes, show promise in expanding healthy lifespans by influencing key biological pathways involved in aging [4].\n\nThe exploration of these biological pathways is fascinating. Many are conserved across species, meaning they've been passed down through evolution. This has led to the development of drugs aimed at extending lifespan by altering these pathways. Such discoveries offer hope for more effective anti-aging therapies [6].\n\nA breakthrough that has garnered significant attention is the use of blood proteins as biomarkers to calculate the aging rates of major organs. This novel approach could revolutionize our understanding of aging at the organ level and guide the development of targeted therapies [14].\n\nAnother intriguing development involves the study of senescent cells, which are cells that lose the ability to divide and contribute to aging. Recent research has confirmed that these cells can indeed degrade surrounding tissues by secreting harmful molecules. Fortunately, we've also discovered methods to remove these accumulated senescent cells, potentially improving healthspan [13].\n\nAdditionally, studies into caloric restriction (CR) show promise in extending lifespan, at least in rodents and some invertebrates. Research is ongoing to determine its effects on aging in nonhuman primates like rhesus monkeys, with initial data appearing promising [2].\n\nThese exciting advancements collectively indicate that the science of aging is rapidly evolving, and while challenges remain, the potential for therapies that could significantly extend healthy human lifespans is becoming increasingly tangible.",

                "content": "Senotherapeutics represent a fascinating approach in the quest to extend human healthspan and potentially lifespan by targeting the cellular aging process, particularly through senolytics and senomorphics. To understand how these agents work, it's essential to delve into their mechanisms at a biological level.\n\nSenotherapeutics target senescent cells (SCs), which are cells that have ceased to divide but remain metabolically active. These cells accumulate with age and contribute to various age-related diseases and overall physiological decline[1]. The accumulation of SCs is associated with the secretion of a pro-inflammatory mix of factors known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can lead to tissue dysfunction and aging-related pathologies[14].\n\nSenolytics are agents designed to selectively induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in SCs. This process helps clear out the harmful senescent cells, thereby ameliorating many diseases associated with senescence and delaying age-related disorders[3][15]. By reducing the burden of senescent cells, senolytics can potentially rejuvenate tissues and improve healthspan.\n\nOn the other hand, senomorphics are compounds that do not kill SCs but rather modulate their function. These agents can alter the phenotype of SCs to resemble that of younger, more functional cells, or they can delay the transition of young cells into a senescent state. They work by interfering with the inflammatory processes associated with SASP or other senescence-related signaling pathways[8][15]. By doing so, senomorphics aim to reduce the pro-inflammatory effects of SCs without inducing apoptosis[10].\n\nThe interest in senotherapeutics is supported by a growing body of research highlighting their potential to transform anti-aging medicine. They have shown promise in experimental and preclinical studies, and their safety and efficacy are being tested in clinical trials[4][9]. However, caution is advised regarding potential dose-dependent side effects, which underscores the need for careful clinical evaluation[5][13].\n\nIn summary, senotherapeutics, through senolytics and senomorphics, offer promising strategies for extending human healthspan and potentially lifespan by targeting the detrimental effects of senescent cells and their secretions. This field continues to evolve, holding the potential for significant breakthroughs in geroscience and age-related disease treatment[12].",

However, using data for AI is not without challenges.\n[10]: This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice. Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes.\n[11]: According to various international reports, Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) is one of the currently emerging fields in educational technology. Whilst it has been around for about 30 years, it is still unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching and learning in higher education.\n[12]: One related research direction are studies of systems that sequentially and continually learn (Lesort et al., 2020) in a lifelong setting, i.e., continual learning without experiencing the well known phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (Traoré et al., 2019). When combined, this research puts forward the following questions: How can we leverage recent advances that situate AI agents within realistic ecological systems? How does the dynamic of such systems drive the acquisition of increasingly complex skills? The rise of AI in interdisciplinary science brings along significant challenges.\n[13]: Given the ever-changing natural world, it is perhaps no surprise that humans and other biological systems have evolved multiple mechanisms for lifelong learning. These include synaptic plasticity rules that protect previously learned associations, mechanisms that create new neural structures or representations when drastic changes are encountered, built-in neuromodulatory drives for persistent exploration, and architectural schemes that use multiple interacting learning and memory systems to · To engineer artificial agents capable of continual learning, artificial intelligence research has taken inspiration from biological inductive biases at several levels.\n[14]: We propose that it is appropriate to more seriously consider the nature of systems that are capable of learning over a lifetime. There are three reasons for taking this position. First, there exists a body of related work for this research under names such as constructive induction, continual learning, sequential task learning and most recently learning with deep architectures. Second, the computational and data storage power of modern computers are capable of implementing and testing machine lifelong learning systems.\n[15]: Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of AI in enhancing educational outcomes, particularly in developing countries, are substantial. This paper explores the disruptive impact of AI on education, highlighting its transformative potential and the obstacles that must be overcome to realize this potential fully.

                "content": "Developing AI systems capable of lifelong learning presents a set of formidable challenges, but also significant opportunities for advancement. One of the primary challenges is overcoming the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, where AI systems tend to lose previously learned information when new data is introduced. This is a significant hurdle because, unlike biological systems, traditional AI architectures lack the mechanisms to preserve past knowledge effectively. Recent research, however, suggests that incorporating biological principles such as synaptic plasticity and neuromodulatory drives may offer viable solutions to this problem, helping AI systems protect learned associations and adapt to new situations without losing old information [12][13].\n\nAnother challenge lies in the dynamic nature of real-world environments. AI systems need to continuously adapt and learn from changing contexts, much like humans do in ecological systems. This requires designing architectures that can handle sequential and complex task learning while also evolving with the system's environment. Researchers have started exploring these aspects through interdisciplinary approaches, seeking to emulate the complexity of human learning processes within AI systems [12].\n\nMoreover, the sheer volume and complexity of data required for AI systems to function effectively pose logistical and computational challenges. The need for high-quality, continuously updated data is paramount, yet collecting and processing such data at scale is not trivial. Modern computational and data storage capabilities have enabled the testing and implementation of machine lifelong learning systems, which provide some relief to this challenge by allowing systems to operate with larger datasets and more complex architectures [9][14].\n\nDespite these hurdles, there is optimism in the field. The potential benefits of AI systems that can learn continuously are substantial, offering transformative possibilities across various domains such as education, healthcare, and beyond [10][15]. As research continues, leveraging interdisciplinary insights and technological advances will be key to developing AI systems that can learn and adapt throughout their lifecycle. While significant progress has been made, addressing these challenges will require ongoing collaboration and innovation across fields [12][13][14].",

                "content": "Transitioning senotherapeutic and senomorphic agents from preclinical studies to human trials involves several significant challenges. One primary obstacle is the translational gap between basic research and clinical application, often referred to as the \"bench-to-bedside\" crisis[2]. This gap represents the difficulty in applying laboratory findings directly to human treatments, and it's a recognized issue in both academic and industrial spheres.\n\nOne challenge in this transition is ensuring that preclinical studies are robust and accurately predictive of human responses. Preclinical studies are critical as they identify lead candidates, determine appropriate formulations, and support the design of clinical trials[4]. However, animal models, which are commonly used in preclinical studies, can sometimes provide misleading results. For example, a drug might be toxic in animal models but not in humans, or vice versa[15]. This discrepancy necessitates careful consideration and validation of preclinical findings before human trials.\n\nMoreover, safety and efficacy are paramount, requiring extensive toxicological studies to assess potential risks to humans[6]. The complexity of cellular senescence, which plays both detrimental and beneficial roles in the body, adds another layer of difficulty. While reducing senescent cell burden holds promise for managing age-related conditions, the dual role of senescence in processes like wound healing and tumor suppression complicates therapeutic targeting[7][10].\n\nCurrent research efforts are attempting to address these challenges through enhanced scientific rigor in preclinical studies and innovative approaches to drug discovery and development. Efforts are being made to improve the design and conduct of preclinical research, emphasizing hypothesis testing and experimental bias reduction[3]. The use of mass spectrometry technology is one example of how the translational pipeline for senotherapeutic development is being accelerated, allowing for better targeting of senescence-associated biomarkers in clinical settings[13].\n\nAdditionally, the establishment of collaborative, multi-site research centers has been suggested as a means to efficiently conduct placebo-controlled studies and foster international drug investigations[17]. Such collaborations can enhance the efficiency and success rate of translating preclinical findings into viable clinical treatments.\n\nWhile challenges remain in transitioning senotherapeutic and senomorphic agents from preclinical to human trials, ongoing research efforts and methodological improvements continue to address these obstacles, paving the way for potential breakthroughs in the management of aging and age-related diseases.",

                "content": "Translating laboratory findings on aging into viable human therapies presents a unique set of challenges and ethical considerations. One of the foremost challenges is the estimation of effectiveness for aging therapies. Since the effects on human aging can take many years to manifest, assessing the efficacy of candidate treatments is inherently complex and time-consuming [1]. This long timeframe is further complicated by the fact that aging interventions must be safe and effective over an extended period, requiring rigorous and prolonged clinical trials [13][14].\n\nAnother significant challenge is the ethical considerations surrounding aging research. As aging research delves into the fundamental biology of aging and seeks to develop interventions that could significantly extend healthspan and lifespan, it raises complex ethical and social issues. These include metaphysical concerns about altering natural life processes, scientific considerations related to the safety and fairness of these interventions, and the broader societal implications, such as their impact on health inequalities and personal identity [9][8].\n\nMoreover, the field calls for a well-defined ethical framework to guide researchers, policymakers, and consumers. This framework is crucial to ensure that the pursuit of extending human health and lifespan does not inadvertently lead to greater health disparities or unintended consequences for how people live and work in later life [8]. The interdisciplinary nature of aging research further complicates these challenges, as it intersects with various domains including biology, ethics, and healthcare policy [9].\n\nIn addition, there are uncertainties regarding the economic impact of treatments aimed at aging. With an aging population, there is already a significant medical and economic burden on society, and any new therapies need to be evaluated not just for their health benefits but also for their cost-effectiveness and accessibility [7]. Ensuring equitable access to these therapies is an ethical imperative to prevent exacerbating existing disparities in healthcare.\n\nIn summary, while the potential for aging therapies to improve human health is immense, translating these findings into human applications requires addressing significant scientific, ethical, and societal challenges. The development of an ethical framework, along with meticulous long-term studies, will be vital to navigate these complexities responsibly.",

The core idea revolves around creating agents or systems that not only persist over extended periods but also evolve and adapt in response to their environments, much like living organisms. These agents are envisioned to harness technologies aimed at understanding and potentially extending human longevity.\n\nIn the realm of human life extension, longevity studies have been a focus of both scientific inquiry and popular imagination for centuries, often featuring in science fiction and utopian narratives[1]. Despite promising initial results in laboratory settings, particularly with animal models, translating these findings to humans remains a complex challenge. Current research endeavors in life extension are extensive and resource-intensive, with some predicting it could take decades before we see significant breakthroughs applicable to human health[2][3]. The study of longevity has started shifting focus from traditional disease treatment to addressing the underlying mechanisms of aging itself, promising potential advancements in extending healthy human lifespans[6].\n\nParallel to biological endeavors, AI has contributed significantly to the concept of lifelong agents. Artificial intelligence systems, particularly those using large language models and machine learning, are being developed to learn continuously and autonomously, simulating a form of artificial life. These systems can adapt and apply scientific and biological knowledge to various domains, including healthcare, which might eventually influence how we approach aging and longevity[12]. AI agents are also playing a role in scientific research, automating processes, and analyzing vast amounts of data to expedite discoveries[14].\n\nIn terms of potential therapies, senotherapeutics and senomorphic agents are showing promise. These are compounds aimed at improving health and possibly extending lifespan by targeting the biological processes associated with aging[13]. However, much of the existing data comes from preclinical animal studies, highlighting the need for further research to address possible side effects and refine these approaches for human application.\n\nWhile the quest for life extension continues, it's important to acknowledge the inherent uncertainties and challenges, including the rigorous scientific and regulatory hurdles that must be overcome[3]. Nonetheless, the ongoing interdisciplinary research efforts hold promise for transforming our understanding of aging and potentially reshaping the future of healthcare[6][8].\n\nNumber of speakers needed: 3\n\nExperts:",

The core idea revolves around creating agents or systems that not only persist over extended periods but also evolve and adapt in response to their environments, much like living organisms. These agents are envisioned to harness technologies aimed at understanding and potentially extending human longevity.\\n\\nIn the realm of human life extension, longevity studies have been a focus of both scientific inquiry and popular imagination for centuries, often featuring in science fiction and utopian narratives[1]. Despite promising initial results in laboratory settings, particularly with animal models, translating these findings to humans remains a complex challenge. Current research endeavors in life extension are extensive and resource-intensive, with some predicting it could take decades before we see significant breakthroughs applicable to human health[2][3]. The study of longevity has started shifting focus from traditional disease treatment to addressing the underlying mechanisms of aging itself, promising potential advancements in extending healthy human lifespans[6].\\n\\nParallel to biological endeavors, AI has contributed significantly to the concept of lifelong agents. Artificial intelligence systems, particularly those using large language models and machine learning, are being developed to learn continuously and autonomously, simulating a form of artificial life. These systems can adapt and apply scientific and biological knowledge to various domains, including healthcare, which might eventually influence how we approach aging and longevity[12]. AI agents are also playing a role in scientific research, automating processes, and analyzing vast amounts of data to expedite discoveries[14].\\n\\nIn terms of potential therapies, senotherapeutics and senomorphic agents are showing promise. These are compounds aimed at improving health and possibly extending lifespan by targeting the biological processes associated with aging[13]. However, much of the existing data comes from preclinical animal studies, highlighting the need for further research to address possible side effects and refine these approaches for human application.\\n\\nWhile the quest for life extension continues, it's important to acknowledge the inherent uncertainties and challenges, including the rigorous scientific and regulatory hurdles that must be overcome[3]. Nonetheless, the ongoing interdisciplinary research efforts hold promise for transforming our understanding of aging and potentially reshaping the future of healthcare[6][8].\\n\\nNumber of speakers needed: 3\\n\\nExperts:\"}]}"

Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of travel, science fiction, and utopian novels. (Question: Background information about life long agents. Query: definition of life long agents)\n[2]: But even if a potential anti-geric compound appears in animal models to postpone or decelerate aging when administered to middle-aged volunteers, documentation that it has an effect on longevity or late-life illnesses in humans is, at minimum, a 20-year exercise, and an expensive one with no certainty of success. We do not know how to measure aging. Research on medicines to help hypertensives depended heavily on the invention of a device to measure blood pressure. Research on antipyretics requires a thermometer, and research on antiobesity agents requires a scale. (Question: Background information about life long agents. Query: definition of life long agents)\n[3]: While agents such as these have some limited laboratory evidence of efficacy in animals, there are no studies to date in humans for drugs that may promote life extension, mainly because research investment remains at a low level, and regulatory standards are high. (Question: Background information about life long agents. Query: definition of life long agents)\n[4]: Breakthroughs in the study of longevity—why humans age, how they age, and interventions to slow the aging process—are fueling the possibility that humans may surpass existing life expectancies and live into their 140s. We are beginning to see a paradigm shift from disease-focused treatments to those that address the underlying mechanisms of aging, biological systems, and wellness. In fact, a growing community of scientific researchers believe they have the tools to extend healthy human life, transforming health care as we know it today. (Question: Background information about life long agents. Query: definition of life long agents)\n[5]: Most people want to live a long and happy life – or at least avoid a short and miserable one. If you’re in that majority, then you’re in luck. Over the last decade, a quiet research revolution has occurred in our understanding of the biology of ageing. The challenge is to turn this knowledge into advice and treatments we can benefit from. Here we bust the myth that lengthening healthy life expectancy is science fiction, and show that it is instead scientific fact. (Question: Background information about life long agents. Query: how do life long agents work)\n[6]: These agents use large language models and generative models to feature structured memory for continual learning and use machine learning tools to incorporate scientific knowledge, biological principles, and theories. AI agents can impact areas ranging from virtual cell simulation, programmable control of phenotypes, and the design of cellular circuits to developing new therapies. ... No articles found. (Question: Background information about life long agents. Query: what are life long agents in AI)\n[7]: The promising capabilities of senotherapeutics to improve health and contribute to the substantial extension of healthy lifespan have already been reported, even if the results currently available showing the effects of these drugs were obtained from preclinical animal studies, which raise legitimate concerns about a potential underestimation of the side effects resulting from a long-term use and chronic administrations. Regarding senomorphics agents, the molecular identification of SASP factors with a detailed characterization of the different pathways responsible for the expected outcomes may enable future interventions in different tissues (Lagoumtzi and Niki, 2021). (Question: Background information about life long agents. Query: what are life long agents in AI)\n[8]: OpenAI’s latest reasoning model, o1, has demonstrated potential in scientific text analysis, accelerating literature reviews and hypothesis generation. It also is capable of math unlike most large language models. Beyond these headline-grabbing advances, AI agents are gradually finding use in research labs, automating experiments and analyzing complex datasets. (Question: Background information about life long agents. Query: what are life long agents in AI)\n[27]: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more prevalent across industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. Artificial intelligence is based on the analysis of large datasets and requires a continuous supply of high-quality data. However, using data for AI is not without challenges. (Question: What are some of the key challenges in developing AI systems that can learn and adapt continuously throughout their lifecycle, and how are current technologies addressing these challenges?. Query: continuous learning AI systems key challenges)\n[28]: This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice. Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. (Question: What are some of the key challenges in developing AI systems that can learn and adapt continuously throughout their lifecycle, and how are current technologies addressing these challenges?. Query: continuous learning AI systems key challenges)\n[29]: One related research direction are studies of systems that sequentially and continually learn (Lesort et al., 2020) in a lifelong setting, i.e., continual learning without experiencing the well known phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (Traoré et al., 2019). When combined, this research puts forward the following questions: How can we leverage recent advances that situate AI agents within realistic ecological systems? How does the dynamic of such systems drive the acquisition of increasingly complex skills? The rise of AI in interdisciplinary science brings along significant challenges. (Question: What are some of the key challenges in developing AI systems that can learn and adapt continuously throughout their lifecycle, and how are current technologies addressing these challenges?. Query: continuous learning AI systems key challenges)\n[30]: Given the ever-changing natural world, it is perhaps no surprise that humans and other biological systems have evolved multiple mechanisms for lifelong learning. These include synaptic plasticity rules that protect previously learned associations, mechanisms that create new neural structures or representations when drastic changes are encountered, built-in neuromodulatory drives for persistent exploration, and architectural schemes that use multiple interacting learning and memory systems to · To engineer artificial agents capable of continual learning, artificial intelligence research has taken inspiration from biological inductive biases at several levels. (Question: What are some of the key challenges in developing AI systems that can learn and adapt continuously throughout their lifecycle, and how are current technologies addressing these challenges?. Query: challenges in developing lifelong learning AI systems)\n[31]: We propose that it is appropriate to more seriously consider the nature of systems that are capable of learning over a lifetime. There are three reasons for taking this position. First, there exists a body of related work for this research under names such as constructive induction, continual learning, sequential task learning and most recently learning with deep architectures.

Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of travel, science fiction, and utopian novels. (Question: Background information about life long agents. Query: definition of life long agents)\\n[2]: But even if a potential anti-geric compound appears in animal models to postpone or decelerate aging when administered to middle-aged volunteers, documentation that it has an effect on longevity or late-life illnesses in humans is, at minimum, a 20-year exercise, and an expensive one with no certainty of success. We do not know how to measure aging. Research on medicines to help hypertensives depended heavily on the invention of a device to measure blood pressure. Research on antipyretics requires a thermometer, and research on antiobesity agents requires a scale. (Question: Background information about life long agents.

One key challenge is estimating the effectiveness of candidate aging therapies, which may require many years to determine their effects on human aging processes [53]. Additionally, the increasing average lifespan of European citizens over the past 50–60 years has led to a rapid growth in the population older than 65, placing substantial medical and economic burdens on society due to age-related diseases and frailty [54].\n\nEthical considerations are crucial in the development of aging therapies. Uncertainties about the impacts of these treatments on health span, lifespan, economic factors, models of care, and health inequalities necessitate the establishment of an ethical framework for geroscience research to guide researchers, policymakers, and consumers [55]. Aging research, as an interdisciplinary field, seeks to understand the biology of aging and develop interventions to maintain health and well-being in older adults, raising complex ethical and social issues [56].\n\nThere are ongoing efforts to translate research findings into clinical applications, such as the investigation of promising drugs and natural compounds like metformin, NAD+ precursors, and senolytics, which are currently undergoing clinical trials to assess their efficacy against age-associated diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative conditions [57]. Additionally, senolytics, which target senescent cells, show emerging benefits for age-related conditions and are being tested in clinical trials for diseases such as osteoarthritis and glaucoma [58]. These endeavors underscore the need for careful navigation of scientific, ethical, and practical barriers in the quest to develop effective aging therapies.",

                "content": "The transition of senotherapeutic and senomorphic agents from preclinical studies to human trials presents several significant challenges. One of the main difficulties is the rift between basic research and clinical research, where translating laboratory findings into practical human applications remains a significant hurdle [33]. This gap is exacerbated by the need for robust preclinical studies designed to identify promising drug candidates, determine optimal formulations, and support clinical trial designs [35]. Additionally, preclinical studies require extensive toxicological data to ensure the safety of potential drugs in humans before they can proceed to clinical trials [36].\n\nCellular senescence, a major contributor to age-related diseases, also poses challenges due to its dual role in human physiology. While it can be beneficial in processes such as wound healing and tumor suppression, persistent senescent cells can negatively affect tissue function [37][38]. As a result, targeting these cells with senolytic drugs in diverse patient populations is being explored to understand the clinical benefits and risks involved [39]. However, animal models used in preclinical studies can sometimes provide misleading results, as drugs toxic to animals may not exhibit the same toxicity in humans, and vice versa [40].\n\nTo address these challenges, it has been suggested that establishing multisite pharmaceutical research centers could facilitate collaborative and efficient studies of new drugs and their indications [41]. These efforts, combined with advancements in mass spectrometry technology, aim to accelerate the translational pipeline for senotherapeutic development [39]. Despite these measures, the complexity and variability of aging processes continue to pose significant obstacles in the development of effective senotherapeutic agents for human use.",

This process is linked to age-related pathologies, making senotherapeutics a promising strategy for extending health span and preventing age-related disorders (ARDs)[16][17]. Senolytics work by targeting and eliminating senescent cells (SCs), thereby ameliorating many senescence-associated diseases and delaying the development of age-related disorders[17]. Research has identified a large number of molecules, including synthetic agents and natural compounds, for their anti-senescence activities, with some tested in clinical trials for their safety and reliability as anti-aging drugs[18].\n\nSenomorphic agents, on the other hand, do not induce apoptosis of SCs but modulate their phenotypes to resemble those of younger cells by interfering with senoinflammation, inflammaging, and senescence-related signaling pathways, including the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)[20]. These agents can transform the anti-aging field, though caution is advised due to potential dose-dependent side effects[19]. Novel senolytics may be developed through chemical libraries or drug repositioning, contributing to an improved understanding of cellular senescence mechanisms[20].\n\nIn addition to small molecules, alternative strategies have been proposed, such as targeting specific proteins involved in senescence to limit the induction of the senescence phenotype[21]. Moreover, mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, which protect against apoptosis, are emerging as useful tools for combating aging, contrasting with the senolytic approach[22].

This process is linked to age-related pathologies, making senotherapeutics a promising strategy for extending health span and preventing age-related disorders (ARDs)[16][17]. Senolytics work by targeting and eliminating senescent cells (SCs), thereby ameliorating many senescence-associated diseases and delaying the development of age-related disorders[17]. Research has identified a large number of molecules, including synthetic agents and natural compounds, for their anti-senescence activities, with some tested in clinical trials for their safety and reliability as anti-aging drugs[18].\\n\\nSenomorphic agents, on the other hand, do not induce apoptosis of SCs but modulate their phenotypes to resemble those of younger cells by interfering with senoinflammation, inflammaging, and senescence-related signaling pathways, including the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)[20]. These agents can transform the anti-aging field, though caution is advised due to potential dose-dependent side effects[19]. Novel senolytics may be developed through chemical libraries or drug repositioning, contributing to an improved understanding of cellular senescence mechanisms[20].\\n\\nIn addition to small molecules, alternative strategies have been proposed, such as targeting specific proteins involved in senescence to limit the induction of the senescence phenotype[21]. Moreover, mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, which protect against apoptosis, are emerging as useful tools for combating aging, contrasting with the senolytic approach[22]. Overall, senotherapeutics present an exciting frontier in anti-aging research, promising to extend healthspan through their varied biological mechanisms.\\n\\nNow give engaging question only.\\nQuestion:\"}]}"

Within this framework, senotherapeutics, which include senolytics and senomorphics, have emerged as promising candidates for extending healthspan and potentially lifespan. Senolytics are designed to selectively eliminate senescent cells, which are known to accumulate with age and contribute to various age-related pathologies[25][26]. Senomorphics, on the other hand, aim to suppress the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which drives sterile inflammation associated with ageing[25]. Additionally, senomorphics can modulate the functions and morphology of senescent cells to resemble those of younger cells or delay the progression of young cells into senescent cells in tissues[26].

Within this framework, senotherapeutics, which include senolytics and senomorphics, have emerged as promising candidates for extending healthspan and potentially lifespan. Senolytics are designed to selectively eliminate senescent cells, which are known to accumulate with age and contribute to various age-related pathologies[25][26]. Senomorphics, on the other hand, aim to suppress the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which drives sterile inflammation associated with ageing[25]. Additionally, senomorphics can modulate the functions and morphology of senescent cells to resemble those of younger cells or delay the progression of young cells into senescent cells in tissues[26]. While the potential of senotherapeutics to revolutionize anti-ageing medicine is significant, it is crucial to approach their use with caution due to possible dose-dependent side effects[24].\\n\\nNow give engaging question only.\\nQuestion:\"}]}"

Modern deep learning techniques have facilitated the development of age predictors that integrate dynamic and static data types, enhancing our ability to predict biological age with precision[42][46]. This progress has been accelerated by the advent of non-invasive aging clocks, which provide a transformative method for assessing biological age, aiding in the development of personalized anti-aging strategies and early detection of age-related health risks on a large scale[43][48].\n\nGenerative AI, particularly through models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), is reshaping scientific research by creating synthetic biological and chemical data that align with training sets, thus facilitating the simulation of complex interactions such as drug interactions[45]. Moreover, AI research tools have been instrumental in automating data analysis, enhancing literature reviews, and generating insights, which streamlines research efforts in the aging field[49].\n\nCollaborative research efforts have demonstrated that advanced AI tools, including Large Language Models (LLMs), can evaluate aging interventions and provide personalized recommendations, which may revolutionize the way interventions are tested and applied[47].

One key challenge is estimating the effectiveness of candidate aging therapies, which may require many years to determine their effects on human aging processes [53]. Additionally, the increasing average lifespan of European citizens over the past 50\\u201360 years has led to a rapid growth in the population older than 65, placing substantial medical and economic burdens on society due to age-related diseases and frailty [54].\\n\\nEthical considerations are crucial in the development of aging therapies. Uncertainties about the impacts of these treatments on health span, lifespan, economic factors, models of care, and health inequalities necessitate the establishment of an ethical framework for geroscience research to guide researchers, policymakers, and consumers [55]. Aging research, as an interdisciplinary field, seeks to understand the biology of aging and develop interventions to maintain health and well-being in older adults, raising complex ethical and social issues [56].\\n\\nThere are ongoing efforts to translate research findings into clinical applications, such as the investigation of promising drugs and natural compounds like metformin, NAD+ precursors, and senolytics, which are currently undergoing clinical trials to assess their efficacy against age-associated diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative conditions [57]. Additionally, senolytics, which target senescent cells, show emerging benefits for age-related conditions and are being tested in clinical trials for diseases such as osteoarthritis and glaucoma [58]. These endeavors underscore the need for careful navigation of scientific, ethical, and practical barriers in the quest to develop effective aging therapies.\\n\\nNow give engaging question only.\\nQuestion: How can we effectively translate groundbreaking laboratory findings on aging into real-world therapies while addressing the significant scientific, ethical, and social challenges involved?\\n\\nNow give engaging answer only with all inline citations from original text.\\nAnswer:\"}]}"

The wish to extend the human lifespan has a long tradition in many cultures. Optimistic views of the possibility of achieving this goal through the latest developments in medicine feature increasingly in serious scientific and philosophical discussion. The authors of this paper argue that research with the explicit aim of extending the human lifespan is both undesirable and morally unacceptable.\n[14]: Our survey supports this idea; the major ethical concerns raised by members of the public reflect the many and diverse issues that are discussed in the bioethics literature (Partridge et al, 2009b; Partridge & Hall, 2007). When pressed, even enthusiasts admit that a drastic extension of human life might be a mixed blessing. A recent review by researchers at the US National Institute on Aging pointed to several economic and social challenges that arise from longevity extension (Sierra et al, 2009).\n[15]: The first question raised is scientific: could these technologies work? On this front the jury is still out, and there are grounds for both optimism and scepticism. Read more: Can ageing really be 'treated' or 'cured'?

                "content": "International collaboration and policy development play crucial roles in addressing the ethical and economic challenges posed by extending human lifespan and implementing aging therapies. Firstly, the scientific community has long recognized the importance of collaboration in advancing medical research, particularly in clinical medicine[3]. Such collaboration can facilitate the sharing of resources, knowledge, and expertise, thereby accelerating breakthroughs in aging therapies.\n\nMoreover, global policies can help harmonize the regulatory frameworks across countries, ensuring that treatments are safe, effective, and accessible. This is exemplified by efforts like the Alzheimer’s Disease Policy Task Force, which brings together various stakeholders to streamline approval processes and coverage for new therapies[8]. These frameworks can serve as a model for the regulation of aging therapies, ensuring they are implemented ethically and equitably.\n\nOn the ethical front, extending human lifespan raises numerous concerns, such as the potential social and economic impacts of an aging population[14]. International dialogue and policy development can address these concerns by promoting public engagement and ethical deliberation, thus ensuring that the voices of diverse populations are heard and considered[7][14]. As global societies face the implications of increased longevity, policies need to be adaptable and inclusive, reflecting the diverse cultural and ethical viewpoints present worldwide.\n\nEconomically, extending lifespan may strain social and healthcare systems if not managed properly[14]. Collaborative international efforts can focus on optimizing healthcare systems to manage increased longevity by investing in preventive care and early interventions[10][9]. This approach can potentially compress morbidity, reducing healthcare costs and enhancing the quality of life for aging populations[4].\n\nIn summary, international collaboration and policy development can address the challenges of lifespan extension by promoting scientific advancement, ensuring ethical implementation, and preparing economies for the changes associated with longer lives. However, ongoing debate and careful consideration of both the scientific feasibility and ethical ramifications of these therapies remain essential[15].",

The wish to extend the human lifespan has a long tradition in many cultures. Optimistic views of the possibility of achieving this goal through the latest developments in medicine feature increasingly in serious scientific and philosophical discussion. The authors of this paper argue that research with the explicit aim of extending the human lifespan is both undesirable and morally unacceptable.\\n[14]: Our survey supports this idea; the major ethical concerns raised by members of the public reflect the many and diverse issues that are discussed in the bioethics literature (Partridge et al, 2009b; Partridge & Hall, 2007). When pressed, even enthusiasts admit that a drastic extension of human life might be a mixed blessing. A recent review by researchers at the US National Institute on Aging pointed to several economic and social challenges that arise from longevity extension (Sierra et al, 2009).\\n[15]: The first question raised is scientific: could these technologies work? On this front the jury is still out, and there are grounds for both optimism and scepticism. Read more: Can ageing really be 'treated' or 'cured'? An evolutionary biologist explains \\u00b7 The second question is just as important: even if lifespan extension is feasible, would it be ethical?\\n\\nStyle of your response should be: conversational and concise\\n\\nNow give your response.

RL has emerged as an efficient technique for solving complicated sequential decision-making tasks in recent years. It offers a great opportunity to open new frontiers in technology where system models are unavailable or too difficult and/or expensive to build. The modern RL is the combination of three research fields, the psychology of human learning, the solution of optimal control using Dynamic Programming (DP), and temporal difference (TD) learning.\n[2]: The utilization of reinforcement learning (RL) within the field of education holds the potential to bring about a significant shift in the way students approach and engage with learning and how teachers evaluate student progress. The use of RL in education allows for personalized and adaptive learning, where the difficulty level can be adjusted based on a student’s performance.\n[3]: U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information ... Intelligent Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently gained a lot of attention due to its ability to optimally control the complex behavior of the HVAC system. However, more exploration is needed on understanding the adaptability challenges that the DRL agent could face during the deployment phase.\n[4]: Intelligent Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently gained a lot of attention due to its ability to optimally control the complex behavior of the HVAC system. However, more exploration is needed on understanding the adaptability challenges that the DRL agent could face during the deployment phase.\n[5]: In this research, we reviewed the literature on reinforcement learning. Because RL can learn independently, it is well suited to dynamic contexts. In both critical and non-critical applications, RL is used. Critical applications include self-driving cars, security, healthcare, energy management systems, and finance. The non-critical applications are those such as Gaming. RL has the potential to revolutionize energy management by allowing systems to adapt and optimize energy use in real time.\n[6]: The growing interest in developing intelligent agents for text-based interactive games, especially those that mimic real-world scenarios , has led to diverse methodologies encompassing RL , behavior cloning (BC) , and prompting LLMs . A well-known example is the game ScienceWorld , where players engage in scientific experiments through environment exploration and interaction. Within the RL framework, state-of-the art employs deep reinforced relevance networks (DRRNs) , treating text-based interactions as partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), and learning distinct text representations for observations and actions to estimate Q-values via a scorer network.\n[7]: View a PDF of the paper titled LLM-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Current and Future Directions, by Chuanneng Sun and 2 other authors View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract:In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great abilities in various tasks, including question answering, arithmetic problem solving, and poem writing, among others. Although research on LLM-as-an-agent has shown that LLM can be applied to Reinforcement Learning (RL) and achieve decent results, the extension of LLM-based RL to Multi-Agent System (MAS) is not trivial, as many aspects, such as coordination and communication between agents, are not considered in the RL frameworks of a single agent.\n[8]: Monitoring recent cross-research on LLM & RL on arXiv for control.

If there are good papers, PRs are welcome.\n[9]: Abstract page for arXiv paper 2306.03604: Enabling Intelligent Interactions between an Agent and an LLM: A Reinforcement Learning Approach\n[10]: With extensive pre-trained knowledge and high-level general capabilities, large language models (LLMs) emerge as a promising avenue to augment reinforcement learning (RL) in aspects such as multi-task learning, sample efficiency, and task planning. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature in LLM-enhanced RL and summarize its characteristics compared to conventional RL methods, aiming to clarify the research scope and directions for future studies. Utilizing the classical agent-environment interaction paradigm, we propose a structured taxonomy to systematically categorize LLMs’ functionalities in RL, including four roles: information processor, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator.\n[11]: In this paper, we explore how to enable intelligent cost-effective interactions between a down stream task oriented agent and an LLM. We find that this problem can be naturally formulated by a Markov decision process (MDP), and propose When2Ask, a reinforcement learning based approach that learns when it is necessary to query LLMs for high-level instructions to accomplish a target task.\n[12]: Keywords: meta-learning, reinforcement learning, meta reinforcement learning, online adaptation · TL;DR: A model-based meta-RL algorithm that enables a real robot to adapt online in dynamic environments\n[13]: Abstract:Although reinforcement learning methods can achieve impressive results in simulation, the real world presents two major challenges: generating samples is exceedingly expensive, and unexpected perturbations or unseen situations cause proficient but specialized policies to fail at test time. Given that it is impractical to train separate policies to accommodate all situations the agent may see in the real world, this work proposes to learn how to quickly and effectively adapt online to new tasks.\n[14]: This thesis studies the applications of distributed reinforcement learning (RL) based machine intelligence to dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in future cognitive wireless networks. In particular, this work focuses on ways of accelerating distributed RL based DSA algorithms in order to improve their adaptability in terms of the initial and steady-state performance, and the quality of service (QoS) convergence behaviour.\n[15]: Exploring more advanced RL techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), could help address this challenge by improving the agent’s learning speed and handling more complex environments. Additionally, incorporating workload prediction models into the RL framework could further enhance its adaptability, allowing the system to proactively adjust task allocations based on expected changes in demand.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational and concise\n\nNow give your response.

                "content": "Integrating reinforcement learning (RL) techniques with large language models (LLMs) offers significant potential to enhance the adaptability of LLM-based agents, particularly in dynamic environments. RL is notably effective in dealing with complex sequential decision-making tasks, leveraging concepts from psychology, dynamic programming, and temporal difference learning[1]. This adaptability is crucial in contexts where system models are either unavailable or too complex to develop, allowing RL to optimize and adapt in real-time to varying conditions[1][5].\n\nThe integration of LLMs with RL can further extend these capabilities by enabling multi-task learning, enhancing sample efficiency, and improving task planning[10]. This synergy can be particularly beneficial for LLMs in dynamic environments, where tasks and preferences continuously evolve. For instance, RL's capability to treat interactions as Markov decision processes can be employed to determine when an LLM should be queried for high-level instructions, optimizing the decision-making process in real-time[11].\n\nFurthermore, RL's adaptability is already being explored in various applications, such as intelligent HVAC control, where it optimally manages complex system behaviors despite facing adaptability challenges during deployment[3][4]. Similarly, in the context of cognitive wireless networks, distributed RL has been utilized to improve adaptability, showcasing the potential for RL to adapt both initially and in steady-state conditions[14].\n\nIn the realm of multi-agent systems, LLMs can also enhance RL by improving communication and coordination between agents, addressing challenges that single-agent RL frameworks might not consider[7]. Overall, the fusion of RL with LLMs represents a promising avenue for developing more adaptable and efficient agents capable of handling evolving tasks and preferences across diverse fields.",

RL has emerged as an efficient technique for solving complicated sequential decision-making tasks in recent years. It offers a great opportunity to open new frontiers in technology where system models are unavailable or too difficult and/or expensive to build. The modern RL is the combination of three research fields, the psychology of human learning, the solution of optimal control using Dynamic Programming (DP), and temporal difference (TD) learning.\\n[2]: The utilization of reinforcement learning (RL) within the field of education holds the potential to bring about a significant shift in the way students approach and engage with learning and how teachers evaluate student progress. The use of RL in education allows for personalized and adaptive learning, where the difficulty level can be adjusted based on a student\\u2019s performance.\\n[3]: U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information ... Intelligent Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently gained a lot of attention due to its ability to optimally control the complex behavior of the HVAC system. However, more exploration is needed on understanding the adaptability challenges that the DRL agent could face during the deployment phase.\\n[4]: Intelligent Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently gained a lot of attention due to its ability to optimally control the complex behavior of the HVAC system. However, more exploration is needed on understanding the adaptability challenges that the DRL agent could face during the deployment phase.\\n[5]: In this research, we reviewed the literature on reinforcement learning. Because RL can learn independently, it is well suited to dynamic contexts. In both critical and non-critical applications, RL is used. Critical applications include self-driving cars, security, healthcare, energy management systems, and finance. The non-critical applications are those such as Gaming. RL has the potential to revolutionize energy management by allowing systems to adapt and optimize energy use in real time.\\n[6]: The growing interest in developing intelligent agents for text-based interactive games, especially those that mimic real-world scenarios , has led to diverse methodologies encompassing RL , behavior cloning (BC) , and prompting LLMs . A well-known example is the game ScienceWorld , where players engage in scientific experiments through environment exploration and interaction. Within the RL framework, state-of-the art employs deep reinforced relevance networks (DRRNs) , treating text-based interactions as partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), and learning distinct text representations for observations and actions to estimate Q-values via a scorer network.\\n[7]: View a PDF of the paper titled LLM-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Current and Future Directions, by Chuanneng Sun and 2 other authors View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract:In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great abilities in various tasks, including question answering, arithmetic problem solving, and poem writing, among others. Although research on LLM-as-an-agent has shown that LLM can be applied to Reinforcement Learning (RL) and achieve decent results, the extension of LLM-based RL to Multi-Agent System (MAS) is not trivial, as many aspects, such as coordination and communication between agents, are not considered in the RL frameworks of a single agent.\\n[8]: Monitoring recent cross-research on LLM & RL on arXiv for control.

If there are good papers, PRs are welcome.\\n[9]: Abstract page for arXiv paper 2306.03604: Enabling Intelligent Interactions between an Agent and an LLM: A Reinforcement Learning Approach\\n[10]: With extensive pre-trained knowledge and high-level general capabilities, large language models (LLMs) emerge as a promising avenue to augment reinforcement learning (RL) in aspects such as multi-task learning, sample efficiency, and task planning. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature in LLM-enhanced RL and summarize its characteristics compared to conventional RL methods, aiming to clarify the research scope and directions for future studies. Utilizing the classical agent-environment interaction paradigm, we propose a structured taxonomy to systematically categorize LLMs\\u2019 functionalities in RL, including four roles: information processor, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator.\\n[11]: In this paper, we explore how to enable intelligent cost-effective interactions between a down stream task oriented agent and an LLM. We find that this problem can be naturally formulated by a Markov decision process (MDP), and propose When2Ask, a reinforcement learning based approach that learns when it is necessary to query LLMs for high-level instructions to accomplish a target task.\\n[12]: Keywords: meta-learning, reinforcement learning, meta reinforcement learning, online adaptation \\u00b7 TL;DR: A model-based meta-RL algorithm that enables a real robot to adapt online in dynamic environments\\n[13]: Abstract:Although reinforcement learning methods can achieve impressive results in simulation, the real world presents two major challenges: generating samples is exceedingly expensive, and unexpected perturbations or unseen situations cause proficient but specialized policies to fail at test time. Given that it is impractical to train separate policies to accommodate all situations the agent may see in the real world, this work proposes to learn how to quickly and effectively adapt online to new tasks.\\n[14]: This thesis studies the applications of distributed reinforcement learning (RL) based machine intelligence to dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in future cognitive wireless networks. In particular, this work focuses on ways of accelerating distributed RL based DSA algorithms in order to improve their adaptability in terms of the initial and steady-state performance, and the quality of service (QoS) convergence behaviour.\\n[15]: Exploring more advanced RL techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), could help address this challenge by improving the agent\\u2019s learning speed and handling more complex environments. Additionally, incorporating workload prediction models into the RL framework could further enhance its adaptability, allowing the system to proactively adjust task allocations based on expected changes in demand.\\n\\nStyle of your response should be: conversational and concise\\n\\nNow give your response.

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing, existing LLM agents are typically designed for static systems and lack the ability to adapt over time in response to new challenges. (Question: please focus on llm based agents. Query: LLM based agents in lifelong learning)\\n[71]: Preprints and early-stage research may not have been peer reviewed yet. ... As the applications of large language models (LLMs) expand across diverse fields, the ability of these models to adapt to ongoing changes in data, tasks, and user preferences becomes crucial. Traditional training methods, relying on static datasets, are increasingly inadequate for coping with the dynamic nature of real-world information. Lifelong learning, also known as continual or incremental learning, addresses this challenge by enabling LLMs to learn continuously and adaptively over their operational lifetime, integrating new knowledge while retaining previously learned information and preventing catastrophic forgetting.

One of the primary difficulties is the requirement for these systems to process and analyze vast amounts of high-quality data continuously, which is crucial for their effective functioning across various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation[27]. In healthcare specifically, challenges arise from the intrinsic complexities of machine learning, logistical issues in system implementation, and sociocultural barriers to adoption, which must be addressed to facilitate the transition from research to clinical practice[28].\n\nAdditionally, a key technical challenge is overcoming the phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting, where AI systems tend to lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new tasks[29]. Addressing this requires leveraging biological systems as a source of inspiration, such as synaptic plasticity and neuromodulatory drives, to enable artificial agents to adaptively retain and integrate new information over time[30].\n\nFurther complicating the development of lifelong learning systems is the need for significant computational and data storage capacities, which are essential for implementing and testing these sophisticated AI architectures[31].

These steps are crucial for designing clinical trials that meet safety and efficacy standards[36].\n\nCellular senescence, a key factor in age-related diseases, complicates the development of these agents[37]. While beneficial in some contexts, persistent senescent cells can harm tissue function, necessitating targeted approaches such as senolytics and senomorphics to manage chronic conditions[37][38]. The promise of these treatments has led to an increased focus on senescence biomarkers and the acceleration of translational pipelines through advanced technologies like mass spectrometry[39].\n\nHowever, animal models used in preclinical research can sometimes yield misleading results, complicating the transition to human trials[40]. Despite these challenges, the establishment of multisite pharmaceutical research centers is proposed to streamline the development process, enabling more efficient collaborative studies[41]. Through such initiatives, researchers aim to bridge the gap between bench and bedside, ultimately improving the transition of senotherapeutic agents into clinical practice[33][41].",

This trend places ever-growing medical and economical burden on society, as many of the older subjects suffer from age-related diseases and frailty. (Question: What are some of the key challenges and ethical considerations you encounter when attempting to translate laboratory findings on aging into viable human therapies?. Query: Ethical considerations in human aging therapy development)\\n[55]: Many uncertainties remain about the effects that treatments for ageing would have on human health span and lifespan, the economy, models of care, health inequalities,personal identity, and how people work and live later in life. There are calls for an ethical framework for geroscience research to help guide researchers, policy makers and consumers. ... Developing an ethical framework for research relating to living well in older age. (Question: What are some of the key challenges and ethical considerations you encounter when attempting to translate laboratory findings on aging into viable human therapies?. Query: Ethical considerations in human aging therapy development)\\n[56]: Aging research represents an interdisciplinary field of science with the goals to understand the biology of aging and aging-related diseases; to establish strategies to maintain health, well-being, and function of adults as they age; and to develop interventions to prevent or reduce the burden of aging and age-related diseases . Aging research raises complex ethical and social issues, which can be generally categorized into three dimensions: metaphysical concerns; scientific considerations; It is widely acknowledged that the responsible development of aging interventions and technology holds significant potential for promoting human well-being. (Question: What are some of the key challenges and ethical considerations you encounter when attempting to translate laboratory findings on aging into viable human therapies?. Query: Ethical considerations in human aging therapy development)\\n[61]: Research on policy issues and phenomena that affect older adults, including aging and development and implementation of programs for older adults in global societies. (Question: How do you think international collaboration and policy development can help tackle the ethical and economic challenges we face in extending human lifespan and rolling out aging therapies?. Query: policy development for aging therapies)\\n[62]: The Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease Policy Task Force is an ad hoc coalition of patient, family caregiver, and professional organizations, working collectively to organize and educate the Alzheimer\\u2019s disease community and decisionmakers on the Food & Drug Administration\\u2019s (FDA) Accelerated Approval pathway, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\\u2019 (CMS) coverage determination processes for amyloid-targeted monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. ... The Talk NERDY (Nurturing Engagement in Research and Development with You) program empowers older adults, their family caregivers, clinicians, and health researchers to learn about patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and how we can all work together to develop \\u2013 and implement \\u2013 research that answers the questions that matter most to patients. (Question: How do you think international collaboration and policy development can help tackle the ethical and economic challenges we face in extending human lifespan and rolling out aging therapies?. Query: policy development for aging therapies)\\n[63]: The aims of this journal is to establish an innovative forum of global aging and health research to advance knowledge in diverse disciplines, to promote early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and intervention of chronic diseases; to disseminate knowledge for optimal translation of research findings into policy and practical settings; to communicate new ideas, findings, perspectives, and research directions; to advocate public policies promoting aging and health in a global context. (Question: How do you think international collaboration and policy development can help tackle the ethical and economic challenges we face in extending human lifespan and rolling out aging therapies?. Query: policy development for aging therapies)\\n[64]: If the goal is to prevent multiple diseases of aging, do you start your antiaging therapies when the first disease hits? The second? \\u201cOnce you're broken, it's really hard to put you back together. It's going to be easier to keep people healthy,\\u201d Kennedy says. So it probably makes more sense to start treatment years earlier, during a healthy middle age. (Question: How do you think international collaboration and policy development can help tackle the ethical and economic challenges we face in extending human lifespan and rolling out aging therapies?. Query: policy development for aging therapies)\\n[65]: Our survey supports this idea; the major ethical concerns raised by members of the public reflect the many and diverse issues that are discussed in the bioethics literature (Partridge et al, 2009b; Partridge & Hall, 2007). When pressed, even enthusiasts admit that a drastic extension of human life might be a mixed blessing. A recent review by researchers at the US National Institute on Aging pointed to several economic and social challenges that arise from longevity extension (Sierra et al, 2009). (Question: How do you think international collaboration and policy development can help tackle the ethical and economic challenges we face in extending human lifespan and rolling out aging therapies?. Query: ethical challenges of extending human lifespan)\\n[66]: The first question raised is scientific: could these technologies work? On this front the jury is still out, and there are grounds for both optimism and scepticism. Read more: Can ageing really be 'treated' or 'cured'? An evolutionary biologist explains \\u00b7 The second question is just as important: even if lifespan extension is feasible, would it be ethical?
