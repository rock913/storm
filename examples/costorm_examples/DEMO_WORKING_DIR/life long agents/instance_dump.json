Collaboration helps share resources and expertise, speeding up breakthroughs in aging therapies[59]. Global policies can harmonize regulatory frameworks, ensuring treatments are safe, effective, and accessible, as seen with initiatives like the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Policy Task Force[62].\n\nEthically, extending lifespan raises concerns about societal impacts, which can be addressed through international dialogue and public engagement[61][65]. Economically, longer lifespans could strain healthcare systems. By focusing on preventive care and early interventions, international efforts can help manage these challenges, compressing morbidity and reducing costs[60][63][64]. In short, collaboration and policy development ensure scientific advancement, ethical practices, and economic preparedness for longer lives[66].",
      "raw_utterance": "International collaboration and policy development play crucial roles in addressing the ethical and economic challenges posed by extending human lifespan and implementing aging therapies. Firstly, the scientific community has long recognized the importance of collaboration in advancing medical research, particularly in clinical medicine[59]. Such collaboration can facilitate the sharing of resources, knowledge, and expertise, thereby accelerating breakthroughs in aging therapies.\n\nMoreover, global policies can help harmonize the regulatory frameworks across countries, ensuring that treatments are safe, effective, and accessible. This is exemplified by efforts like the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Policy Task Force, which brings together various stakeholders to streamline approval processes and coverage for new therapies[62]. These frameworks can serve as a model for the regulation of aging therapies, ensuring they are implemented ethically and equitably.\n\nOn the ethical front, extending human lifespan raises numerous concerns, such as the potential social and economic impacts of an aging population[65]. International dialogue and policy development can address these concerns by promoting public engagement and ethical deliberation, thus ensuring that the voices of diverse populations are heard and considered[61][65]. As global societies face the implications of increased longevity, policies need to be adaptable and inclusive, reflecting the diverse cultural and ethical viewpoints present worldwide.\n\nEconomically, extending lifespan may strain social and healthcare systems if not managed properly[65]. Collaborative international efforts can focus on optimizing healthcare systems to manage increased longevity by investing in preventive care and early interventions[63][64]. This approach can potentially compress morbidity, reducing healthcare costs and enhancing the quality of life for aging populations[60].\n\nIn summary, international collaboration and policy development can address the challenges of lifespan extension by promoting scientific advancement, ensuring ethical implementation, and preparing economies for the changes associated with longer lives. However, ongoing debate and careful consideration of both the scientific feasibility and ethical ramifications of these therapies remain essential[66].",

RL excels in complex decision-making, drawing from psychology and dynamic programming to adapt in real-time[72][75]. This synergy could enable LLMs to handle evolving tasks more efficiently, using RL's strengths in multi-task learning and task planning[77]. For example, RL can optimize when to engage LLMs for high-level decisions, treating interactions as Markov decision processes[78].\n\nWe've already seen RL's adaptability in action with applications like intelligent HVAC control and cognitive wireless networks, where it manages complex behaviors despite adaptability challenges[73][74][79]. Moreover, LLMs can enhance RL in multi-agent systems by improving communication and coordination[76]. This integration promises more adaptable and efficient agents across various fields.",

RL is notably effective in dealing with complex sequential decision-making tasks, leveraging concepts from psychology, dynamic programming, and temporal difference learning[72]. This adaptability is crucial in contexts where system models are either unavailable or too complex to develop, allowing RL to optimize and adapt in real-time to varying conditions[72][75].\n\nThe integration of LLMs with RL can further extend these capabilities by enabling multi-task learning, enhancing sample efficiency, and improving task planning[77]. This synergy can be particularly beneficial for LLMs in dynamic environments, where tasks and preferences continuously evolve. For instance, RL's capability to treat interactions as Markov decision processes can be employed to determine when an LLM should be queried for high-level instructions, optimizing the decision-making process in real-time[78].\n\nFurthermore, RL's adaptability is already being explored in various applications, such as intelligent HVAC control, where it optimally manages complex system behaviors despite facing adaptability challenges during deployment[73][74]. Similarly, in the context of cognitive wireless networks, distributed RL has been utilized to improve adaptability, showcasing the potential for RL to adapt both initially and in steady-state conditions[79].\n\nIn the realm of multi-agent systems, LLMs can also enhance RL by improving communication and coordination between agents, addressing challenges that single-agent RL frameworks might not consider[76].

      "utterance": "Senotherapeutics represent a fascinating approach in the quest to extend human healthspan and potentially lifespan by targeting the cellular aging process, particularly through senolytics and senomorphics. To understand how these agents work, it's essential to delve into their mechanisms at a biological level.\n\nSenotherapeutics target senescent cells (SCs), which are cells that have ceased to divide but remain metabolically active. These cells accumulate with age and contribute to various age-related diseases and overall physiological decline[16]. The accumulation of SCs is associated with the secretion of a pro-inflammatory mix of factors known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can lead to tissue dysfunction and aging-related pathologies[25].\n\nSenolytics are agents designed to selectively induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in SCs.

      "raw_utterance": "Senotherapeutics represent a fascinating approach in the quest to extend human healthspan and potentially lifespan by targeting the cellular aging process, particularly through senolytics and senomorphics. To understand how these agents work, it's essential to delve into their mechanisms at a biological level.\n\nSenotherapeutics target senescent cells (SCs), which are cells that have ceased to divide but remain metabolically active. These cells accumulate with age and contribute to various age-related diseases and overall physiological decline[16]. The accumulation of SCs is associated with the secretion of a pro-inflammatory mix of factors known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can lead to tissue dysfunction and aging-related pathologies[25].\n\nSenolytics are agents designed to selectively induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in SCs. This process helps clear out the harmful senescent cells, thereby ameliorating many diseases associated with senescence and delaying age-related disorders[17][26].

            "Cellular senescence is a major contributor to age-related diseases in humans; however, it also has a beneficial role in physiological and pathological processes, including wound healing, host immunity, and tumour suppression. Reducing the burden of cell senescence in animal models of cardiometabolic disorders, inflammatory conditions, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer using pharmaceutical approaches that selectively target senescent cells (ie, senolytics) or that suppress senescence-associated secretory phenotype (ie, senomorphics) holds great promise for the management of chronic age-associated conditions.",
            "However, the repurposing of existing drugs and the use of new senotherapeutics are associated with various side-effects; incomplete functional characterisation of peripheral tissues at systemic administration; an absence of standardised guidelines for timing, dose, and route of administration; and a paucity of efficacy and safety data from clinical trials. Therefore, the full potential of senotherapeutics has been hampered in clinical applications. The scope of this Review is to summarise the state-of-art literature on the benefits and risks of senotherapeutics (particularly senolytics) and on their use in patients with ageing-related disease. We will not address the use of these agents in chemotherapy-induced senescence, given that this has already been reviewed by Prasanna and colleagues.",

A notable application is the use of modern deep learning techniques to develop age predictors, which enable researchers to integrate dynamic and static data types previously considered incompatible. This integration facilitates a holistic view of biological processes, allowing the creation of causal models that can pinpoint critical features and identify biological targets and mechanisms crucial for understanding aging[42][46].\n\nAI is also revolutionizing aging research through non-invasive aging clocks. These tools represent a new paradigm by allowing precise assessments of biological aging. Implementing deep learning models in this context helps advance preventive and personalized anti-aging strategies and facilitates early detection of age-related health risks across large populations[43][48]. The rapid development of these technologies has given rise to longevity medicine, empowering clinicians with tools to monitor patients' biological age through various modalities such as hematological tests and metabolomics[44].\n\nFurthermore, generative AI is making significant strides in aging research by generating synthetic biological and chemical data that is statistically congruent with real-world data. This capability is critical in simulating complex biological interactions and potentially developing new therapies, thereby reshaping scientific inquiry in aging[45][50].

These cells degrade surrounding tissue by secreting harmful molecules, a damaging impact that was previously controversial but is now understood more clearly. Importantly, it has been discovered that these accumulated senescent cells can be removed, offering potential therapeutic avenues to extend healthspan as we age[14].\n\nIn 2023, Tony Wyss-Coray and his team at Stanford University made a significant breakthrough by calculating the rate of aging in 11 major organs using proteins in the blood known as biomarkers. This advancement provides a deeper insight into the biological processes of aging and holds promise for developing strategies to slow down the aging process and improve overall health in older adults[15].",

Senolytics work by targeting and eliminating senescent cells (SCs), thereby ameliorating many senescence-associated diseases and delaying the development of age-related disorders[17]. Research has identified a large number of molecules, including synthetic agents and natural compounds, for their anti-senescence activities, with some tested in clinical trials for their safety and reliability as anti-aging drugs[18].\n\nSenomorphic agents, on the other hand, do not induce apoptosis of SCs but modulate their phenotypes to resemble those of younger cells by interfering with senoinflammation, inflammaging, and senescence-related signaling pathways, including the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)[20]. These agents can transform the anti-aging field, though caution is advised due to potential dose-dependent side effects[19]. Novel senolytics may be developed through chemical libraries or drug repositioning, contributing to an improved understanding of cellular senescence mechanisms[20].\n\nIn addition to small molecules, alternative strategies have been proposed, such as targeting specific proteins involved in senescence to limit the induction of the senescence phenotype[21].

Modern deep learning techniques have facilitated the development of age predictors that integrate dynamic and static data types, enhancing our ability to predict biological age with precision[42][46]. This progress has been accelerated by the advent of non-invasive aging clocks, which provide a transformative method for assessing biological age, aiding in the development of personalized anti-aging strategies and early detection of age-related health risks on a large scale[43][48].\n\nGenerative AI, particularly through models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), is reshaping scientific research by creating synthetic biological and chemical data that align with training sets, thus facilitating the simulation of complex interactions such as drug interactions[45]. Moreover, AI research tools have been instrumental in automating data analysis, enhancing literature reviews, and generating insights, which streamlines research efforts in the aging field[49].\n\nCollaborative research efforts have demonstrated that advanced AI tools, including Large Language Models (LLMs), can evaluate aging interventions and provide personalized recommendations, which may revolutionize the way interventions are tested and applied[47]. AI agents are also being developed to simulate virtual cells, control phenotypes, design cellular circuits, and develop new therapies, showcasing their potential impact in aging research and beyond[50]. As AI continues to integrate into research processes, even the preliminary stages of research can benefit from AI tools that synthesize information from vast databases, facilitating efficient literature reviews and saving researchers' time[51]. The vision of \"AI scientists\" involves systems capable of skeptical learning and reasoning, empowering biomedical research through collaborative integration with experimental platforms, thus retaining human involvement in the discovery process while enhancing capabilities[52].",

One significant challenge is evaluating the efficacy of potential agents, such as metformin, NAD+ precursors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, TORC1 inhibitors, spermidine, senolytics, probiotics, and anti-inflammatories, in clinical settings against age-associated diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases[57]. Clinical trials are essential in this evaluation process, and notable efforts have been made, particularly in the area of senolytics, where emerging evidence suggests benefits for senescence- and age-related conditions[58]. Researchers like Judy Campisi have been pivotal in advancing senolytic drugs into trials with specific disease indications, such as osteoarthritis and glaucoma[58].\n\nFurthermore, international collaboration and policy development play crucial roles in addressing the ethical and economic challenges of extending human lifespan and implementing aging therapies. Such collaborations are critical for the development of clinical medicine, particularly in the context of a global approach to health challenges[59]. There is also an interest in slowing the aging process to extend health span by reducing illness and infirmity at the end of life, a concept referred to as \"compressing morbidity\"[60]. These challenges require a concerted effort from researchers, policymakers, and global health organizations to ensure that the pursuit of extending human lifespan is both ethical and economically viable.",

Over the past 50-60 years, advancements in medical care and improvements in living conditions have significantly increased the average lifespan of European citizens, leading to a rapid growth in the population aged over 65 years[54]. This demographic shift presents considerable medical and economic burdens on society, as many older individuals suffer from age-related diseases and frailty[54]. As researchers endeavor to translate laboratory findings on aging into viable human therapies, numerous uncertainties remain regarding the effects these treatments could have on human health span, lifespan, the economy, and social structures such as health inequalities and personal identity[55].\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of aging research raises complex ethical and social issues, which can be broadly categorized into metaphysical concerns, scientific considerations, and the potential for promoting human well-being through responsible development of aging interventions and technologies[56]. The prospect of significantly extending human lifespan has been met with mixed reactions, as it poses economic and social challenges, including potential changes in workforce dynamics and healthcare needs[65].\n\nGiven these challenges, there is a call for an ethical framework to guide geroscience research, ensuring that it is conducted responsibly and equitably, and that the resulting therapies are accessible and beneficial to all segments of society[55]. Furthermore, international collaboration and policy development are essential in addressing these ethical and economic challenges, as they can foster the dissemination of knowledge and the implementation of research findings into practical settings on a global scale[61][63]. The development of public policies that promote aging and health within a global context can help manage the complexities associated with extending human lifespan and the rollout of aging therapies[63].",

Uncertainties about the impacts of these treatments on health span, lifespan, economic factors, models of care, and health inequalities necessitate the establishment of an ethical framework for geroscience research to guide researchers, policymakers, and consumers [55]. Aging research, as an interdisciplinary field, seeks to understand the biology of aging and develop interventions to maintain health and well-being in older adults, raising complex ethical and social issues [56].\n\nThere are ongoing efforts to translate research findings into clinical applications, such as the investigation of promising drugs and natural compounds like metformin, NAD+ precursors, and senolytics, which are currently undergoing clinical trials to assess their efficacy against age-associated diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative conditions [57]. Additionally, senolytics, which target senescent cells, show emerging benefits for age-related conditions and are being tested in clinical trials for diseases such as osteoarthritis and glaucoma [58].

A structured taxonomy has been proposed to systematically categorize these functionalities, providing a clearer research scope and directions for future studies[77].\n\nIn practical applications, methods like When2Ask have been developed, which utilize reinforcement learning to determine optimal moments for querying LLMs. This approach is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling agents to seek high-level instructions from LLMs when necessary, thus ensuring intelligent and cost-effective interactions tailored to specific tasks[78].",

          "In this research, we reviewed the literature on reinforcement learning. Because RL can learn independently, it is well suited to dynamic contexts. In both critical and non-critical applications, RL is used. Critical applications include self-driving cars, security, healthcare, energy management systems, and finance. The non-critical applications are those such as Gaming. RL has the potential to revolutionize energy management by allowing systems to adapt and optimize energy use in real time."

Although research on LLM-as-an-agent has shown that LLM can be applied to Reinforcement Learning (RL) and achieve decent results, the extension of LLM-based RL to Multi-Agent System (MAS) is not trivial, as many aspects, such as coordination and communication between agents, are not considered in the RL frameworks of a single agent."

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature in LLM-enhanced RL and summarize its characteristics compared to conventional RL methods, aiming to clarify the research scope and directions for future studies.
