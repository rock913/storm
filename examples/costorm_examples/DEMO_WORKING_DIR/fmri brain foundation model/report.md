# Background Information
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique that has revolutionized brain mapping research due to its noninvasive and safe nature, as it does not involve injections, surgery, ingestion of substances, or exposure to ionizing radiation[6][10]. Since its rise in popularity in the early 1990s, fMRI has been extensively used to measure and map brain activity by imaging changes in blood flow related to energy use by brain cells[10]. It has been applied to study various processes of the mind and brain, as well as the relationship between psychological and neural processes[7]. Doctors use fMRI to understand how the brain functions in normal, diseased, or injured states and to assess potential risks of brain surgery, although its clinical use is primarily approved for surgical planning[5].

In recent years, the concept of the fMRI brain foundation model has emerged, focusing on translating neuroscience knowledge to the practice of prevention and treatment of neurobehavioral problems[1]. Researchers are exploring the use of fMRI in foundational research to identify emotion-regulatory and cognitive tasks that engage relevant brain areas[9]. This approach also includes the development of brain foundation models capable of adapting to new tasks, predicting anatomical cell types, and understanding neuronal connectivity[2]. As neuroscience collects larger, multi-modal datasets, foundation models are expected to uncover statistical regularities, facilitating rapid adaptation and accelerating research[2]. The Brain Language Model (BrainLM) exemplifies this by using a self-supervised masked-prediction training approach on extensive fMRI recordings, demonstrating its capability in both fine-tuning and zero-shot inference tasks[4].

However, fMRI techniques face challenges such as high costs and limited portability, which restrict their application in some prevention efforts[9]. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the need for careful statistical analyses in fMRI research due to the complexity of the data, as a significant number of early studies did not use corrected comparisons, though this has improved over time[3]. Despite these challenges, fMRI continues to play a critical role in advancing our understanding of brain dynamics and supporting the development of foundational models that could transform neuroscience research and its applications[1][8].
# Development Techniques

## SelfSupervised Learning in Brain Foundation Models
Self-supervised learning techniques have been pivotal in advancing brain foundation models, enabling them to learn from large-scale brain data without the necessity for extensive labeled datasets. These techniques, which have seen remarkable success in natural language processing, allow models to decode mental states by identifying specific patterns of brain activity associated with emotions like anger or joy[11][13]. The approach is analogous to how models in vision applications learn to recognize visual scenes based on their inherent similarities and differences, without relying on labeled inputs[12][17].

The ability of brain foundation models like BrainLM to perform tasks such as zero-shot inference is significantly enhanced through self-supervised learning, often surpassing previous fully supervised models[14]. This advancement is particularly beneficial in scientific machine learning applications where the availability of annotated data is limited. Self-supervised training has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in medical applications, such as diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder, demonstrating remarkable improvements in accuracy and efficiency[15].

Furthermore, self-supervised learning mitigates the challenges posed by the requirement for large quantities of labeled data, which is a notable limitation in the training of deep supervised models, especially in medical imaging and brain disease diagnosis[16][18]. This paradigm shift holds the potential to revolutionize how foundational brain models are developed and applied, paving the way for more efficient and scalable solutions in neuroscience and healthcare.
## Data Transparency and Sharing Initiatives in Neuroscience
Data transparency and sharing are pivotal for ensuring reproducibility and enhancing the impact of scientific research in the field of neuroscience. The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) provides a searchable infrastructure catalog designed to assist researchers in selecting suitable neuroscience data repositories. This catalog is informed by a checklist developed by Sandström et al. (2022), which guides users in repository selection[160]. Additionally, several repository finder tools are available, such as the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) for neuroimaging-related repositories, re3data, the National Library of Medicine's catalog of open data repositories, and the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) listing of BRAIN Initiative Repositories[160].

A notable example of a data sharing initiative is OpenNeuro, a data archive supported by the BRAIN Initiative. OpenNeuro allows for the open sharing of a wide array of brain imaging data types and adheres to the FAIR principles—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability—which are essential for effective data sharing[161]. These initiatives highlight the importance of transparent data sharing practices in improving the reproducibility and standardization of research, particularly in the domain of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)[161].
# Clinical Applications
The clinical applications of fMRI brain foundation models are diverse and hold significant promise for advancing neuroscience and medicine. One of the key strengths of these models is their ability to predict clinical variables such as age, anxiety, and PTSD, and to forecast future brain states through fine-tuning and zero-shot inference tasks[19]. fMRI, specifically using Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) imaging, has been employed extensively since its inception in 1990 for various clinical applications, including surgical planning, treatment monitoring, and as a biomarker in pharmacologic and training programs[20].

These foundation models have the potential to transform neurobehavioral treatments by providing insights into brain activity dynamics and enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks[22]. For example, the integration of self-supervised learning and transfer learning into these models may reshape neuroscience research landscapes and enhance the efficacy of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs)[24]. By leveraging these advanced modeling techniques, it becomes feasible to monitor and diagnose disease states more effectively and even facilitate brain-controlled machines and enhanced communication systems[25].

However, the high costs and limited portability of fMRI techniques pose challenges to their widespread use in prevention science[23]. To address these limitations, foundational research using fMRI can help identify tasks that reliably engage relevant brain areas, thereby informing targeted interventions. Additionally, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) are contributing to translational efforts aimed at treating neurobehavioral problems, further demonstrating the utility of fMRI brain foundation models in clinical settings[27]. Despite these advancements, there is a pressing need for effective medical foundation models capable of handling various downstream tasks without the reliance on large-scale labeled datasets[21].
# Limitations
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) presents several limitations in its application for training and validating brain foundation models. One of the primary challenges is the high dimensionality of fMRI data, which requires extensive time for training deep learning networks and necessitates more efficient learning techniques to accurately interpret brain voxels with minimal misclassification error[31]. Additionally, the slow temporal resolution of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response in fMRI complicates the differentiation of neural activities associated with specific stimuli or tasks when they occur in rapid succession, leading to overlapping signals that pose a significant challenge in cognitive neuroscience research[32].

Despite its high spatial resolution and whole-brain coverage capabilities, fMRI can be cumbersome for subjects due to factors like being confined in a small space, the inability to move, and exposure to excessive noise during scanning. These issues may contribute to the preference for more portable, less invasive, and lower-cost tools in some research scenarios[30]. Moreover, the potential for environmental disturbances, such as lighting conditions and auditory noise, further limits the applications of fMRI in consumer neuroscience[30].

Furthermore, ethical considerations arise due to the wide dissemination and expanding applications of fMRI, prompting discussions about the boundaries of its capabilities and the need for transparent communication to the public[29]. While advancements in real-time fMRI have addressed some limitations of previous EEG-based techniques, challenges remain in achieving efficient learning and accurate interpretation necessary for brain foundation models[28].
# Ethical Considerations

## Patient Privacy and Consent

### Informed Consent Processes
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, particularly those utilizing brain foundation models, necessitate a stringent informed consent process due to the sensitive nature of the personal health information involved. Informed consent is a cornerstone of ethical biomedical research, ensuring that participants voluntarily confirm their willingness to partake in a study after being adequately informed of its aims, risks, and benefits[36]. This process is crucial given that most research fMRI studies are conducted by investigators who may not be specialists in reading brain images, raising concerns about unrecognized incidental findings[34]. Such findings, if overlooked, could have significant implications for the participants, emphasizing the importance of appropriate referral and follow-up[33].

Institutional and research contexts, which vary between sites, also influence the strategies employed to handle incidental findings, thereby affecting the informed consent process[35]. Moreover, recent developments, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR), highlight the evolving nature of consent regulations. For instance, Germany now permits the secondary use of data without consent for scientific research, following a careful assessment of the interests involved[37]. This shift underscores the ongoing balance between advancing scientific research and protecting patient privacy, requiring informed consent processes to be continuously updated and aligned with national and international regulations. Personal health information, which includes any identifiable data concerning an individual's health status, remains a sensitive area demanding careful handling during the research process[38].
### Multimodal Data Integration Ethics
The integration of multimodal neuroimaging techniques such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI presents significant ethical challenges related to data privacy and informed consent due to the sensitive nature of neuroimaging data and its potential for misuse in both clinical and research contexts[76]. While modalities like EEG and MEG do not easily lend themselves to identifying individuals, exceptions exist, such as the identification of specific seizure disorders through EEG data, which could potentially be coupled with other data to identify an individual[76]. The challenges are further compounded by the expansion of collaborative networks and data sharing initiatives aimed at advancing scientific research[77]. Such initiatives are invaluable for scientific progress but must be navigated carefully to protect individual privacy rights and maintain ethical standards[77].

The ethical considerations are underscored by datasets like the Mother Of Unification Studies (MOUS) dataset, which includes comprehensive multimodal neuroimaging data from hundreds of subjects, combining structural MRI with functional data obtained during tasks and at rest[79]. Similarly, other datasets involve the acquisition of functional and structural neuroimaging data, including EEG, MEG, and fMRI, during specific tasks, highlighting the complexity and depth of the data collected[78]. As researchers increasingly utilize open access datasets, such as those comprising EEG and MRI data collected from healthy individuals, maintaining stringent ethical standards regarding privacy and informed consent becomes crucial[80]. Addressing these ethical challenges requires robust protocols for data protection, transparency in data usage, and informed consent processes that fully educate participants about the potential uses and risks of their data.
## Ethical Challenges in Neuroimaging
The integration of multimodal neuroimaging techniques, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, presents significant ethical challenges related to data privacy and informed consent, especially given the sensitive nature of the data and its potential misuse in both clinical and research contexts. Recent legal changes, notably in the EU, have simplified some aspects by granting control back to participants. The most critical elements in this context are obtaining thorough and transparent informed consent and, when appropriate, informed assent. Approval from the local medical ethics committee or institutional review board is mandatory for research studies involving neuroimaging, in line with the Declaration of Helsinki[81].

The NIH BRAIN Initiative Neuroethics Working Group has prioritized ethical challenges, focusing on risk analysis, informed consent, and post-trial responsibilities[82]. The global scientific community generally adheres to ethical regulations, but variations in legal rules between regions can affect reporting practices. The COVID-19 pandemic further complicated obtaining informed consent due to the risk of infection and resource allocation to clinical rather than research activities[83].

To protect individuals from informational or discriminatory harm, measures such as forbidding the reidentification of neuroscience data are proposed. For example, the UK's Data Protection Act criminalizes the reidentification of deidentified data without consent, a provision that can be more effective than private data use agreements[84]. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are tasked with evaluating privacy and confidentiality risks in research, ensuring that projects using identifiable data undergo rigorous ethical review. In neuroimaging, the field of neuroethics extends beyond regulatory compliance to include the interface between scientists and society[85].
## Standardized Ethical Guidelines
The protection of privacy for research participants is a widely recognized ethical requirement in clinical research, highlighting the importance of privacy safeguards in the fMRI research setting[86]. However, it remains unclear how research professionals perceive privacy concepts and the specific scenarios requiring these protections. Given the potential ethical concerns related to fMRI neurofeedback technology, there is a pressing need for these issues to be communicated to the public to aid in the development of protective frameworks[87]. This calls for a collaborative international effort to establish standardized ethical guidelines for fMRI research, addressing privacy concerns and preventing misuse of neural data across different jurisdictions[87]. Furthermore, research ethics, including informed consent and ethics reviews, are integral to achieving ethical and practical goals in real-world research[88]. To ensure effectiveness, these ethical measures must adhere to high standards, as demonstrated by an examination of consent forms for MRI and fMRI studies approved by Canadian research ethics boards[88].
## International Collaboration
International collaboration is essential in establishing standardized ethical guidelines for fMRI research, particularly to address privacy concerns and prevent the misuse of neural data across different jurisdictions. Such collaborations facilitate the organization of medical education sessions, scientific meetings, symposia, seminars, and workshops that are crucial for low-income and developing countries, despite the ethical challenges that arise in the implementation of these projects[89]. These collaborative efforts are guided by the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, proposed by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences in collaboration with the World Health Organization[89].

Successful modern research collaborations increasingly involve scientists from different countries, driven by the need to engage in interdisciplinary science, access innovative problem-solving approaches, and gain expertise beyond one's own research group[90]. This international collaboration helps to establish a global network of colleagues with diverse scientific and cultural backgrounds[90]. Furthermore, the current ethical framework for collaborative international health research is primarily influenced by the ethical standards of developed countries[91]. Therefore, international collaboration is crucial in creating equitable and effective ethical guidelines that are globally applicable in the context of fMRI research.

This openness not only enhances the reliability of research outcomes but also plays a significant role in the decision-making process by embodying accountability and accessibility[140].

Several guidelines have been established to enhance the transparency and quality of research reporting, such as the CONSORT guidelines for clinical trials and the STROBE initiative for observational studies[139]. In the realm of fMRI studies, Poldrack and his colleagues have proposed specific guidelines aimed at improving the consistency and quality of reporting[139]. These guidelines are aligned with similar efforts in other areas of bioscience, such as the MIAME guidelines for microarray research, demonstrating a broad movement towards standardized reporting across various scientific domains[137].

Efforts to adhere to these guidelines and promote transparent reporting in fMRI studies are vital in improving the reliability and reproducibility of research models, ultimately bolstering scientific rigor and fostering a more robust understanding of brain function[137][138][139].
#### Addressing Reproducibility Challenges
Addressing reproducibility challenges in fMRI research involves several strategic approaches to ensure consistent and reliable outcomes. One significant advancement is the use of ICA-based cleaning methods for resting state fMRI data, which have been shown to enhance reproducibility by providing more consistent data across studies[142]. Additionally, the choice of analysis templates, such as those used in dual regression, plays a crucial role in the reliability of results, highlighting the importance of standardized methodologies in the research community[142].

Robustness against analytical variability is essential, meaning that findings should be consistently identifiable despite variations in methodological approaches[143]. To achieve this, it is vital to incorporate tools and practices that enhance reproducibility and replicability across different studies, thereby strengthening the scientific foundation of psychological and brain research[143].

The field also contends with the challenge of replicability, which is complicated by the flexibility researchers have during data analysis, leading to a higher incidence of false positive results[144]. The Neuroimaging Analysis Replication and Prediction Study (NARPS) aims to address this issue by providing empirical evidence on the variability of results across different analysis teams, thereby promoting more rigorous standards in neuroimaging research[144]. These combined efforts underscore the importance of transparency and methodological rigor in overcoming reproducibility challenges in fMRI studies.

Funding bodies have mandated that data sharing be a fundamental consideration in all genomics funding applications, impacting scientific practices, especially in publishing and research conduct[155]. The data generated in genomics are often made available to the scientific community, facilitated by collaborations between private and public entities, like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through initiatives such as STRIDES[156]. To safeguard privacy while promoting transparency, a code of conduct is enforced internationally, requiring researchers to prove their institutional status and adhere to ethical standards, thereby granting them access to genomic databases[157]. Furthermore, innovative consent mechanisms, such as dynamic consent, have been introduced by companies to foster robust data-sharing frameworks[158]. The successful data sharing principles that underpinned the Human Genome Project continue to serve as a benchmark, even as challenges to free information sharing persist[159]. Adopting these frameworks in fMRI research could significantly improve data sharing practices, ensuring data integrity and fostering collaborative advancements.
