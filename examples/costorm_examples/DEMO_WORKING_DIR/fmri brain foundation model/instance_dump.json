Similarly, decoding language signals to \"read\" words or narratives from brain activity is pushing boundaries in BCIs and language processing, but it raises ethical concerns around mental privacy[58][62][60][63][68]. Progress in optimizing brain variance metrics has improved reconstruction accuracy, with potential applications in treating neurological conditions[59][63][66].

      "raw_utterance": "Recent advancements in applying AI to brain encoding and decoding, particularly using fMRI, have highlighted significant progress and ongoing challenges in the field. Brain decoding involves predicting external stimuli or internal mental states based on brain activity, while encoding focuses on predicting brain responses to specific inputs[61][64].\n\nA prominent area of research is reconstructing perceived images or imagined visuals from fMRI data. Generative models, such as Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise in this domain[57][63]. For example, studies have successfully reconstructed low- and high-level features of visuals\u2014such as object categories or scene semantics\u2014but integrating these features for complex scenes remains challenging[67].\n\nAI has also been applied to decode language signals in the brain, enabling researchers to \"read\" streams of words or even recount stories based on brain activity[58][62]. This is a critical step toward advancing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and understanding language processing[63][68]. However, concerns about mental privacy highlight ethical considerations as these technologies advance[60].\n\nEfforts to enhance model performance have explored optimizing image reconstruction based on brain variance metrics, leading to more accurate and reliable results across different feature spaces[66]. Additionally, applications of decoding models extend to clinical contexts, such as treating psychological and neurological conditions, showcasing the real-world utility of this research[59][63].\n\nDespite progress, challenges remain. Current methods often rely on single modalities and lack robustness in capturing complex brain functions[64][68]. Further integration of advanced machine learning techniques and multimodal approaches is essential for addressing these limitations and improving both accuracy and generalizability[57][65].",

Informed consent should be detailed and transparent, ensuring participants understand data use, storage, and risks, such as re-identification from combined datasets, even for modalities like EEG[76][84]. Legal safeguards, like the UK\u2019s Data Protection Act, are critical to prevent unauthorized re-identification, offering stronger protections than private data agreements[84]. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) play a key role in assessing privacy risks, especially for collaborative data sharing, alongside governance measures like controlled access and secure data-sharing protocols[77][85].\n\nOn the technical side, advanced de-identification and encryption methods should be standard, especially for open-access datasets combining multimodal data[78][80]. Beyond regulations, the field must engage in ongoing neuroethical discussions to anticipate broader misuse risks, like in insurance or employment discrimination[82][85]. Balancing scientific openness with privacy across diverse global frameworks remains a challenge, requiring adaptive strategies to responsibly advance multimodal research[83].",
      "raw_utterance": "Tackling ethical challenges around data privacy and informed consent in multimodal neuroimaging research\u2014such as combining techniques like EEG, MEG, and fMRI\u2014requires a multi-faceted approach, given the sensitivity and potential for misuse of neuroimaging data.\n\nFirst, informed consent must be thorough, transparent, and adapted to the complexities of multimodal neuroimaging. This means clearly explaining to participants how their data will be used, shared, and stored, especially in light of global ethical regulations like the Declaration of Helsinki[81]. Researchers must ensure participants are fully aware of the potential risks, including re-identification through unique data patterns, as even modalities like EEG, typically harder to identify individuals with, can sometimes carry identifiable artifacts such as seizure patterns when combined with other datasets[76][84].\n\nSecond, robust legal frameworks can mitigate misuse. For example, laws like the UK\u2019s Data Protection Act prohibit the re-identification of anonymized neuroimaging data without proper consent[84]. These legal safeguards are more effective than relying solely on private agreements such as data use agreements, as they create enforceable protections against misuse.\n\nAdditionally, ethical approval by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) is crucial for evaluating risks to privacy and confidentiality, particularly when data sharing across collaborative networks is involved. IRBs are responsible for ensuring that privacy risks are minimized and that there are no significant loopholes in data handling[85]. Data-sharing initiatives should also incorporate governance measures, such as limiting access to sensitive datasets and requiring agreements to prevent misuse[77].\n\nFurthermore, technological solutions can bolster privacy protections. For instance, advanced de-identification methods and secure data-sharing protocols should be standard practice, particularly given the growing reliance on open-access datasets like the MOUS dataset or others involving combined EEG, MEG, and fMRI data[78][79][80].\n\nLastly, as the field evolves, neuroethics must extend beyond regulatory compliance to address broader societal implications, such as potential misuse of neuroimaging data in areas like insurance or employment discrimination. Continuous dialogue between researchers, ethicists, and policymakers is essential to anticipate and mitigate these risks[82][85].\n\nWhile strides are being made in data protection, challenges remain. For instance, achieving a balance between scientific openness and privacy is complex, especially given the global variations in legal and ethical standards[83].

Protecting participant privacy is a widely recognized ethical requirement in clinical research, but the specifics of privacy protection can vary across different research settings and jurisdictions, leading to inconsistencies [86][88].\n\nThe ethical challenges of fMRI research, particularly with its potential to inadvertently expose sensitive personal information, necessitate a comprehensive, global approach to ethics. Given the complex ethical issues associated with fMRI neurofeedback and similar technologies, there is a call for further consideration and discussion within the research community to proactively address these concerns [87].\n\nSuccessful modern research collaborations often span multiple countries, driven by the need for interdisciplinary engagement and innovative problem-solving approaches [90]. Such collaborations can provide a platform for developing universally accepted ethical guidelines, drawing on diverse expertise and perspectives. However, ethical guidelines for collaborative research often stem from standards set by developed countries, which may not always align with practices or needs in other regions [91].\n\nThere are established international frameworks, such as those from the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, developed in collaboration with WHO, that guide biomedical research ethics [89]. These guidelines can serve as a model for developing specific standards for fMRI research, but they must be adapted to address the unique privacy and ethical challenges posed by neural data collection and analysis.\n\nIn summary, fostering international collaboration to create standardized ethical guidelines for fMRI research is essential.

            "Fluency in English and good writing skills are therefore essential for success in scientific research. Research in the life sciences is increasingly collaborative, both at the national and international levels. This can help to alleviate the problem of language barriers; yet, collaborating with a native speaker for the explicit purpose of writing a manuscript raises new ethical challenges, in particular in regard to what constitutes authorship.",
            "In this article, I explore what constitutes authorship in a scientific context, and consider how international writing collaborations could solve the problem of publishing successfully as a non-native speaker without falling foul of ethical hurdles. Such writing partnerships could become a legitimate form of research collaboration, as long as strict, well-defined rules of authorship and publishing are agreed and adhered to.",
            "There are four possible solutions that, combined, might solve the problems surrounding authorship: detailed and publicly available ethical guidelines for each research institution related to research and its publication; a system that can better quantify the participation of an author, and thus their position in a manuscript byline; new authorship guidelines that serve both the publishing and the scientific community; and global rules on research and writing CPCs together with local ethical guidelines to address culture-specific issues.",

            "Scientific research is truly global in scope, with international collaborations, conferences, journals, databases, and so on. Although science transcends national boundaries, with the exception of research involving human subjects, there are no definitive international standards for research integrity. International standards for the ethical conduct of research with human subjects have been in place since the adoption of the Nuremberg Code after the end of World War II (Nuremberg Code, 1949).",
            "Long before the ORI and ESF organized this conference, journal editors from around the world have collaborated on some ethical standards dealing with research integrity. For example, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), has ethical standards dealing with authorship, conflict of interest, and protection of human and animal subjects. Seven-hundred journals follow the ICMJE standards (ICMJE, 2008). The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), an organization that promotes integrity in peer-reviewed scientific publications, has ethical standards pertaining to research misconduct, peer review, authorship, redundant publication, conflict of interest, data analysis, and protecting human and animal subjects.",
            "In November 2005, University of Pittsburgh scientist Gerald Schatten, who collaborated with Hwang on the 2005 article, accused Hwang of misleading members of the research team about the sources of human oocytes used in the research. Hwang admitted that some of the oocytes came from women working in his lab, which was not illegal in South Korea, but was ethically questionable.",
            "Schatten was never accused of fabricating data but a committee at his university found that he had shirked his authorship responsibilities and accepted excessive consulting fees ($40,000) for collaborating with Hwang over an 18-month period (Resnik, et al. 2006, Saunders and Savulescu, 2008). International standards for research integrity are important for several reasons. First, because research is often international in scope, it is necessary to have ethical standards that transcend national boundaries to resolve disputes that may arise when the parties come from different countries."

      "utterance": "It's fascinating how recent research on brain encoding and decoding with movie datasets is pushing the boundaries, especially using fMRI. Movies provide dynamic visual stimuli, and this has helped in visual perception studies[92][98]. A big hurdle is the slow BOLD signals in fMRI, which complicate modeling brain activity for such stimuli[92]. But deep learning, with tools like DNNs, GANs, and VAEs, is making strides in decoding brain responses more accurately[93][99].\n\nFor instance, fMRI can now decode object and action categories in movies with impressive precision, achieving AUC scores over 0.9[97]. Innovations include using graph convolutional networks and preprocessing datasets to enhance performance and reduce overfitting[94][95]. Generative AI, like Stable Diffusion, is even helping reconstruct mental images from fMRI data[100].\n\nStill, challenges exist, such as small datasets and the need for separate models for encoding and decoding, affecting robustness[95]. Researchers are looking to refine these models, blend modalities, and address computational hurdles to improve decoding accuracy and generalizability[93][96]. The field is rapidly evolving, making movies an intriguing and complex platform for these explorations.",
      "raw_utterance": "Recent research on brain encoding and decoding using movie datasets has demonstrated remarkable advancements, particularly leveraging functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain decoding, which involves predicting external stimuli from brain activity, has been extensively explored in visual perception studies, as movies provide rich, dynamic visual stimuli[92][98].\n\nA notable challenge in this domain is the slow nature of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals in fMRI, making it difficult to model brain activity elicited by dynamic stimuli like movies[92]. However, advancements in deep learning have addressed this issue. Techniques such as deep neural networks (DNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and variational auto-encoders (VAEs) have been employed to decode brain responses more effectively[93][99]. These models help reconstruct visual stimuli, including movie frames, from brain activity with increasing accuracy.\n\nInterestingly, studies have demonstrated that using fMRI data, it is possible to decode the presence of object and action categories within movies. This has been achieved with high accuracy, such as area-under-curve (AUC) scores exceeding 0.9, showcasing the potential of fMRI for fine-grained decoding[97]. Recent works also incorporate graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and emphasize reducing overfitting and training time by preprocessing datasets, like those from the Human Connectome Project, to improve model performance[94][95].\n\nAdditionally, advances in generative AI, such as Stable Diffusion, have enabled researchers to reconstruct images viewed or imagined in the mind using fMRI data[100]. These methods are rapidly evolving, highlighting both the promise and challenges of decoding continuous and dynamic stimuli like movies.\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain. For example, traditional models often struggle with small datasets and require separate encoding and decoding models, which can limit their robustness[95]. Future research is focused on refining these models, integrating multimodal approaches, and addressing computational constraints for more accurate and generalizable decoding[93][96].\n\nOverall, the integration of cutting-edge machine learning techniques and neuroimaging is transforming our ability to decode and understand brain activity, with movie datasets serving as an exciting and challenging testbed for further exploration.",

This makes directly linking BOLD signals to specific neural activities challenging, as it doesn't clearly differentiate between types of neural processing, such as excitation versus inhibition[103].\n\nDynamic visual stimuli add complexity with their transient BOLD responses, indicating significant temporal patterns in neural activity[101]. The BOLD signal's temporal dynamics\u2014like initial overshoot and post-stimulus undershoot\u2014further complicate interpretations[102].\n\nRecent insights suggest that sophisticated modeling can enhance fMRI data decoding. Current models often struggle with BOLD's biological complexity, not fully separating intrinsic variance from artefacts[105]. Advances in ultra-high field MRI now allow sub-millimeter resolution, which could better resolve these challenges by incorporating more detailed neurovascular coupling across cortical layers and blood flow regulation[104][106].\n\nOverall, while interpreting BOLD signals in dynamic stimuli is challenging, improvements in neuroimaging and modeling may offer better frameworks for decoding neural activity.",

The BOLD signal is influenced by changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin levels, which are affected by cerebral blood flow, volume, and oxygen metabolism[102]. This complexity makes it difficult to link BOLD signals directly to specific neural activities, especially given the BOLD signal's inability to clearly distinguish between different types of neural processing, such as excitation versus inhibition or bottom-up versus top-down signals[103].\n\nDynamic visual stimuli add another layer of complexity due to the transient nature of the BOLD response. Studies have shown that both transient and sustained BOLD responses can occur with visual stimuli, indicating that temporal patterns of neural activity can significantly shape the BOLD signal[101]. Moreover, the temporal dynamics of the BOLD signal, such as the initial overshoot, steady-state activation, and post-stimulus undershoot, complicate the interpretation further[102].\n\nRecent neuroscience insights suggest that integrating more sophisticated modeling approaches could improve the decoding of fMRI data. Current models often struggle to account for the rich information contained in BOLD signals, partly because they don't fully separate intrinsic biological signal variance from extrinsic artefacts[105]. Advances in ultra-high field MRI technology have made sub-millimeter resolution possible, offering the potential to better resolve these complexities by incorporating additional compartments and terms into mesoscopic models[104][106]. These models could consider factors like differences in neurovascular coupling across cortical layers and the spatial scale of blood flow regulation[106].\n\nIn summary, while there are significant challenges in biologically interpreting BOLD signals from dynamic visual stimuli, ongoing advances in neuroimaging technology and modeling could provide better frameworks for understanding these complex relationships. These improvements could enhance the accuracy and utility of fMRI decoding models, leading to more precise interpretations of neural activity in response to dynamic visual stimuli.",

Logothetis whose earlier research supported the prevailing explanation (Logothetis et al., 2001 ) himself recently concluded that the \u201cfMRI signal cannot easily differentiate between function-specific processing and neuromodulation, between bottom-up and top-down signals, and it may potentially confuse excitation and inhibition\u201d (Logothetis, 2008 , p.",

Although powerful fMRI techniques hold promise when applied to prevention science and practice, their expense (see the subsequent section on fMRI limitations) and lack of portability constrain their use in prevention efforts. One way around this limitation is to use fMRI in foundational research to identify tasks, both emotion-regulatory and cognitive, that consistently recruit relevant brain areas.",

Advanced machine learning models, especially deep learning, offer a promising path forward by adeptly separating overlapping neural events, thus reducing variability and false positives in fMRI data[122][127]. These models can help recognize consistent spatial patterns, emphasizing reliable outcomes over mere statistical significance[124][125]. Additionally, by standardizing workflows, machine learning can minimize biases and methodological inconsistencies that often lead to variability[121][126]. However, challenges remain, including the complexity and resource demands of these models, as well as the need for transparency and standardization to tackle the reproducibility crisis in machine learning itself[126][127]. Addressing these issues through standardized workflows and rigorous validation is key to leveraging machine learning effectively in fMRI research.",

Leveraging advanced machine learning models presents a promising approach to enhance reproducibility by effectively separating overlapping neural events. The complexity of fMRI data analysis often leads to variability in results, partly due to the many degrees of freedom researchers have during the process[122]. This variability can result in false positives, which undermine the reliability of findings.\n\nAdvanced machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have shown great potential in handling complex datasets[127]. These models can be trained to recognize reproducible spatial patterns in fMRI data, rather than merely focusing on statistical significance, which can contribute to more reliable outcomes[124][125]. Additionally, machine learning can help standardize analysis workflows, reducing the influence of individual biases and methodological inconsistencies that currently contribute to variability in fMRI studies[121][126].\n\nHowever, the application of machine learning to enhance reproducibility also faces challenges. The inherent complexity of deep learning models, coupled with issues like data leakage and computational demands, can make these models difficult to implement systematically and document thoroughly[126]. Moreover, the reproducibility crisis in machine learning itself, characterized by a lack of transparency and standardized reporting, underscores the need for careful application and rigorous validation of these techniques in fMRI research[127].\n\nIn summary, while advanced machine learning models offer significant potential to improve the reproducibility of fMRI experiments by better separating overlapping neural events, their successful integration requires addressing both the technical and methodological challenges inherent in both fMRI research and machine learning[126][127].

In fMRI studies, reproducibility requires that the same local activation maps are likely to be observed in an experimental replication. A successful replication is certainly not the ultimate proof; it is a modest, yet important, contribution to scientific certainty.",

The reproducible evidence is gathered from the separate runs within the study. The associated empirical Bayes and ROC extensions of the linear model provide parameter estimates to determine reproducibility. Empirical applications of the methodology suggest that reproducible evidence is robust to small sample sizes and sensitive to both the magnitude and persistency of brain activation. It is demonstrated that research findings in fMRI studies would be more compelling with supporting reproducible evidence in addition to standard hypothesis testing evidence.",

By making methodological details clear, replication and reliability of results can be improved [141].\n\nDomain-specific insights also play a crucial role. Understanding variability across different analytical methods can help develop practices that yield consistent findings despite these variations [143]. The NARPS study, for instance, highlights the need to address degrees of freedom in data analysis, a major factor in false-positive rates [144]. Focusing on these insights allows for designing studies that are both reproducible and robust, strengthening fMRI research [143].",
      "raw_utterance": "Addressing the reproducibility challenges in fMRI research requires a comprehensive approach centered on transparent and detailed reporting of methodologies. The development of community standards, akin to the MIAME guidelines for microarray research and the CONSORT guidelines for clinical trials, has been suggested for fMRI studies[137]. This involves establishing guidelines, such as those proposed by Poldrack and colleagues, which have been advocated to improve the quality, transparency, and consistency of fMRI research reporting[139]. Transparent reporting includes making methodologies, data sources, and analysis techniques accessible and clear to other researchers, thus enabling the replication of studies[138][140].\n\nThe role of data transparency is crucial as it embodies openness and accountability, which are essential in addressing reproducibility concerns[140]. Ensuring that methodologies are fully and transparently reported allows other researchers to repeat protocols and methods accurately, which is vital for methods reproducibility[138][141]. The lack of such standards has led to issues where variations in analysis settings, especially in rfMRI studies, have contributed to low reproducibility rates[142]. By making methodological details clearly visible, researchers can better replicate studies, thereby increasing the reliability of results[141].\n\nDomain-specific insights play a significant role in enhancing the reliability of fMRI models. For instance, understanding the variability across different analytical methods can aid in developing robust practices that result in consistent findings despite methodological variations[143]. The Neuroimaging Analysis Replication and Prediction Study (NARPS) highlighted the importance of addressing the degrees of freedom in data analysis, which is a key factor in the high rate of false-positive results[144]. By focusing on domain-specific challenges, researchers can better design studies that are not only reproducible but also robust to analytical variability, thereby strengthening the scientific foundation of fMRI research[143].\n\nIn conclusion, tackling reproducibility challenges in fMRI research involves a multifaceted approach that includes the adoption of comprehensive reporting guidelines, fostering transparency, and leveraging domain-specific insights to enhance the robustness and reliability of research findings.",

Concerns over validity and reliability in fMRI are frequently discussed in major journals like Nature Neuroscience and Nature Communications[145][146]. One major issue is the variability in results due to the many degrees of freedom in data analysis, which can lead to high false positive rates[150]. This is part of a wider \"reproducibility crisis\" seen across scientific fields[148].\n\nFor fMRI, the costs involved in data collection and processing make robust inferences essential[149]. Increasing sample sizes is one way to improve replicability, as current sizes are often inadequate[147]. There's also a proposal for a model-based reproducibility index to quantify this aspect better, which could be particularly useful for large-scale studies[152].\n\nTaking cues from other fields, like the MIAME guidelines for microarrays, we could work towards similar standards for fMRI reporting[153]. Modern tech, such as cloud services, can enhance standardization and replicability by providing fault tolerance across analyses[151]. Addressing these methodological issues is vital not only for scientific integrity but also for public trust in research[154].",

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has faced scrutiny regarding the validity and reliability of its conclusions, as highlighted by the ongoing concerns expressed in prominent journals such as Nature Neuroscience and Nature Communications[145][146]. A significant factor contributing to these concerns is the variability in results due to the numerous degrees of freedom researchers have during data analysis, which can lead to a high rate of false positive results[150].\n\nThe issue of reproducibility is not unique to fMRI but is part of a broader \"reproducibility/replicability crisis\" acknowledged across various scientific disciplines[148]. For fMRI specifically, the costs associated with data collection, storage, and processing are considerable, thus necessitating that the inferences derived from such data are robust and meaningful[149]. One suggestion for enhancing reproducibility involves increasing sample sizes in fMRI studies, as current sample sizes often result in only modest replicability[147].\n\nFurthermore, the development of a model-based reproducibility index for fMRI studies has been proposed to quantify reproducibility effectively, potentially benefiting large-scale studies[152]. Additionally, drawing inspiration from other fields, such as the MIAME guidelines for microarray research, the fMRI community is encouraged to work towards establishing a community standard for methodological reporting[153].\n\nEfforts to improve standardization can also benefit from modern technological solutions, such as cloud services designed to enhance standardization and replicability by ensuring fault tolerance and robustness across different analyses[151].

The visualization of bibliographic information is especially valuable for experts because it allows real-time detection of unexpected trends, gaps in scientific knowledge, statistical biases, and other important characteristics of research fronts . VOSviewer  and CiteSpace  are most often used; however, ready-made programs are often seen as having limitations, since their functionality is standardized and often does not support innovative approaches . Therefore, sometimes less common software products are used, for example, Cytoscape  or BibTechMon , including programs written for a specific study .",

Additionally, structured repositories like the INCF and OpenNeuro play crucial roles by ensuring data adheres to FAIR principles\u2014Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable\u2014thus promoting transparency and reproducibility[160][161].\n\nLastly, genomics' dynamic consent models and codes of conduct could address privacy concerns in fMRI research, enabling ethical data use while fostering openness[157][158].

One exemplary model is the Human Genome Project, where data sharing was a foundational principle that significantly contributed to its success.

This condition has influenced scientific practices, notably in publishing and research conduct, emphasizing the need for transparency[155]. Moreover, initiatives like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) STRIDES program showcase collaborations with cloud platforms to facilitate data sharing and analyses, providing a potential model for fMRI research[156].\n\nThe use of structured repositories is another effective strategy. For instance, in neuroscience, the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) provides a catalog of data repositories, aiding researchers in locating suitable platforms for data sharing[160]. Similarly, OpenNeuro, part of the BRAIN Initiative, offers a repository for sharing a wide range of brain imaging data, adhering to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), which ensures transparency and reproducibility[161].\n\nFurthermore, in genomics, dynamic consent models and internationally agreed codes of conduct ensure ethical data use while enhancing transparency. Such frameworks could be adapted to address privacy concerns in fMRI research while promoting data sharing[157][158].\n\nIn conclusion, adopting these successful data transparency initiatives from genomics and neuroscience could significantly enhance reproducibility and standardization in fMRI research.

      "utterance": "The use of fMRI brain foundation models in clinical applications holds remarkable promise, particularly in transforming neurobehavioral treatments and brain-machine interfaces. These models, such as the Brain Language Model (BrainLM), are trained on extensive fMRI recordings and exhibit proficiency in tasks that are crucial for clinical settings, including the prediction of clinical variables like age, anxiety, and PTSD, and the forecasting of future brain states[19]. This predictive capability can significantly enhance personalized treatment plans by allowing for more precise monitoring and adjustment of therapies based on an individual's predicted brain activity patterns.\n\nOne of the most transformative applications of these models is in the realm of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). With the advancement in brain encoding and decoding techniques, foundation models can enhance communication and control in BMIs by improving the accuracy of decoding neural signals into actionable commands for machines[25]. This can be especially beneficial for individuals with motor disabilities, providing them with greater autonomy through improved assistive technologies.\n\nMoreover, fMRI has already been used in clinical settings for surgical planning and assessing treatment outcomes[20]. With the integration of foundation models, there is potential for even more nuanced insights, such as the identification of specific anatomical cell types and neuronal connectivity, which could lead to more targeted interventions[22]. These models also offer the possibility of accurately predicting anatomical and functional aspects of the brain without requiring large labeled datasets, which is a significant advancement given the complexity and cost of collecting such data[21].\n\nIn addition to these applications, fMRI foundation models can play a crucial role in understanding and treating neurobehavioral disorders. By leveraging self-supervised learning and transfer learning, these models can help identify key brain areas involved in emotion regulation and cognition, thus informing new therapeutic approaches[23][24]. The ability to measure resting state and task-induced brain activity can provide insights into the default mode network and other functional networks that are often disrupted in neurobehavioral disorders[26][27].\n\nWhile there are limitations, such as the high cost and lack of portability of fMRI technology[23], the continued development of these models and the accumulation of multi-modal datasets will likely overcome some of these barriers, enabling more widespread and effective clinical use[22].

These models, such as the Brain Language Model (BrainLM), are trained on extensive fMRI recordings and exhibit proficiency in tasks that are crucial for clinical settings, including the prediction of clinical variables like age, anxiety, and PTSD, and the forecasting of future brain states[19]. This predictive capability can significantly enhance personalized treatment plans by allowing for more precise monitoring and adjustment of therapies based on an individual's predicted brain activity patterns.\n\nOne of the most transformative applications of these models is in the realm of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). With the advancement in brain encoding and decoding techniques, foundation models can enhance communication and control in BMIs by improving the accuracy of decoding neural signals into actionable commands for machines[25]. This can be especially beneficial for individuals with motor disabilities, providing them with greater autonomy through improved assistive technologies.\n\nMoreover, fMRI has already been used in clinical settings for surgical planning and assessing treatment outcomes[20]. With the integration of foundation models, there is potential for even more nuanced insights, such as the identification of specific anatomical cell types and neuronal connectivity, which could lead to more targeted interventions[22]. These models also offer the possibility of accurately predicting anatomical and functional aspects of the brain without requiring large labeled datasets, which is a significant advancement given the complexity and cost of collecting such data[21].\n\nIn addition to these applications, fMRI foundation models can play a crucial role in understanding and treating neurobehavioral disorders. By leveraging self-supervised learning and transfer learning, these models can help identify key brain areas involved in emotion regulation and cognition, thus informing new therapeutic approaches[23][24]. The ability to measure resting state and task-induced brain activity can provide insights into the default mode network and other functional networks that are often disrupted in neurobehavioral disorders[26][27].\n\nWhile there are limitations, such as the high cost and lack of portability of fMRI technology[23], the continued development of these models and the accumulation of multi-modal datasets will likely overcome some of these barriers, enabling more widespread and effective clinical use[22]. Overall, fMRI brain foundation models have the potential to revolutionize neurobehavioral treatments and BMIs by providing deeper insights into brain function and more personalized and effective interventions.",

No function or behavior appears too complex for neuroscience to tackle\u2014from how children learn language (Kuhl, 2010) to the memory systems that preserve our experiences and knowledge (Squire, 2009)\u2014and advances continue at a breathtaking pace. As in all areas of biomedical research, a crucial challenge for neuroscientists is to translate the knowledge derived from scientific inquiry into practical tools or programs that improve people\u2019s lives.",
            "Teaching participants to control neural responses in a localized region is also a non-invasive means to manipulate brain activity so researchers can examine the effects on behavior and perhaps draw causal inferences about function (Caria, Sitaram, & Birbaumer, 2012).

            "This allows for investigating plastic changes that take place due to neurofeedback training as well as for investigating how modulating brain activity in the trained ROI affects processing in other brain areas (Lee et al., 2011, 2012; Rota et al., 2011). At this point, we have not been able to identify any topics in the cognitive neurosciences addressed with fMRI that cannot also be investigated with rtfMRI-based approaches. Given the novelty of the field, important questions regarding its use are beginning to be addressed, examples of which are provided in Box 2. What are the limitations of rtfMRI for scientific investigation in cognitive neuroscience?",

While the future of rtfMRI neurofeedback can lead towards some exciting applications in a multitude of neurological and psychiatric disorders, we are currently just beginning to scratch the surface of where it can be applied. This section discusses both the immediate future and long-term future of fMRI-based neurofeedback.",
            "For example, a recent study on depression by some of the co-authors identified the brain areas responsive to positive emotional stimuli at the start of each neurofeedback session and used these functionally defined areas as ROIs for the self-regulation training (Linden et al., 2012). One of the first steps before clinical implementation is to evaluate the potential risks involved. When safety guidelines are properly followed, MRI and fMRI are regarded as relatively risk-free methods."

            "Overlapping signals in fMRI are a significant challenge in cognitive neuroscience research, particularly when multiple stimuli or tasks are presented in close temporal proximity. The BOLD response has a slow temporal resolution compared to the rapid succession of cognitive events. This causes signals from different brain processes to overlap, making it difficult to differentiate which neural activity is associated with specific stimuli or tasks.",
            "The study was used to highlight the need for more careful statistical analyses in fMRI research, given the large number of voxels in a typical fMRI scan and the multiple comparisons problem. Before the controversies were publicized in 2010, between 25 and 40% of studies on fMRI being published were not using the corrected comparisons. But by 2012, that number had dropped to 10%. Dr. Sally Satel, writing in Time, cautioned that while brain scans have scientific value, individual brain areas often serve multiple purposes and \"reverse inferences\" as commonly used in press reports carry a significant chance of drawing invalid conclusions.",
            "This overlap reduces the precision of event-related fMRI analyses, complicating interpretations of brain function. Traditional fMRI designs, such as block or event-related designs, face limitations in managing this signal overlap, especially in studies with non-randomized, alternating designs, where the same tasks or stimuli may appear repeatedly and close together. As a result, the timing of stimuli becomes a crucial factor in ensuring that the fMRI signal from one event is sufficiently distinct from the next. To address these challenges, researchers employ techniques like deconvolution, which mathematically separates the overlapping BOLD responses.",

Current limitations and challenges in fMRI, alongside emerging research, point to several areas where progress could significantly impact the accuracy and efficiency of these models.\n\nOne major area for improvement lies in the spatial and temporal resolution of fMRI data. While fMRI provides excellent spatial resolution compared to many other imaging techniques, its temporal resolution is relatively slow because it measures changes in blood flow (hemodynamic response) rather than direct neuronal activity. This temporal limitation makes it difficult to capture the rapid dynamics of neural processes, which are crucial for building more robust models of brain function[39][48]. Developing fMRI technologies with faster sampling rates or integrating complementary methods, such as electrophysiological recordings, could help bridge this gap. For example, combining fMRI with techniques like ERP (event-related potentials) might offer a more comprehensive understanding of brain activity over time[46].\n\nAnother key limitation is the issue of statistical reliability in fMRI analyses. Early research highlighted concerns about statistical methods, particularly the risks associated with false positives due to multiple comparisons across thousands of voxels in a scan[40]. Although advancements in statistical rigor have reduced this problem in recent years, further progress in machine learning-driven denoising algorithms and better correction methods could enhance the reliability of fMRI data for training foundation models. Improving the reproducibility of these data sets is critical to ensuring that brain foundation models are trained on consistent and valid representations of neural activity[44].\n\nFunctional connectivity mapping is another promising direction. Instead of focusing solely on which brain areas are active, researchers are increasingly analyzing patterns of connectivity between regions during specific tasks or at rest[44]. This shift toward understanding large-scale brain networks, such as resting-state networks (RSNs), has already provided powerful insights into functional integration across the brain[42]. Enhancing the precision of functional connectivity analyses, particularly across different frequency bands, could improve the interpretability of the data and enable models to better capture the brain\u2019s distributed and dynamic nature[42][48].\n\nAdditionally, there is significant potential in the development of high-resolution datasets, such as the Individual Brain Charting project, which could serve as benchmarks for training brain foundation models[43]. Large, high-quality datasets enable models to generalize better and learn more nuanced patterns of neural activity. Standardizing such data sets and ensuring they are representative across populations could further enhance model accuracy.\n\nEmerging technologies like neurofeedback tools, such as decoded neurofeedback (DecNef) and functional-connectivity-based neurofeedback (FCNef), also show promise. These tools use real-time fMRI data to modulate brain activity and behavior, which could provide unique insights into how specific brain regions and networks contribute to cognition and behavior[47]. Incorporating insights from these technologies into the training of foundation models might lead to more precise mappings of brain function.\n\nIn summary, advancements in fMRI technology that improve temporal resolution, statistical reliability, and functional connectivity mapping, coupled with the creation of high-resolution standardized datasets, are critical for enhancing the quality of neural data. These improvements could lead to brain foundation models that are more accurate in representing neural dynamics and more efficient in their ability to predict and analyze brain function.

Courtesy of Dr. Richard Buxton, UC San Diego \u00b7 MRI has become a standard tool for Radiology because it provides high resolution images with good contrast between different tissues.",
            "The essential observation was that when neural activity increased in a particular area of the brain, the MR signal also increased by a small amount. Although this effect involves a signal change of only about 1%, it is still the basis for most of the fMRI studies done today.",
            "In the simplest fMRI experiment a subject alternates between periods of doing a particular task and a control state, such as 30 second blocks looking at a visual stimulus alternating with 30 second blocks with eyes closed. The fMRI data is analyzed to identify brain areas in which the MR signal has a matching pattern of changes, and these areas are taken to be activated by the stimulus (in this example, the visual cortex at the back of the head).",
            "For reasons that we still do not fully understand, neural activity triggers a much larger change in blood flow than in oxygen metabolism, and this leads to the blood being more oxygenated when neural activity increases. This somewhat paradoxical blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect is the basis for fMRI. Blood flow to an area of the brain is remarkably sensitive to changes in neural activity."

      "utterance": "Ensuring that the BrainLM model effectively integrates and learns from diverse neural data, such as fMRI signals, while maintaining robustness and generalization across tasks and brain regions, is a multifaceted challenge. This process demands a careful blend of advanced computational strategies, preprocessing rigor, and interpretability to handle the complexity of fMRI data.\n\nOne of the key approaches involves leveraging self-supervised learning techniques, such as the masked-prediction training strategy utilized in BrainLM. This method trains the model to predict missing or masked portions of the data, enabling it to learn representations that capture the underlying structure of brain activity dynamics across extensive datasets. For instance, BrainLM was trained on a vast dataset of 6,700 hours of fMRI recordings, which supports its ability to generalize effectively to new tasks, both in fine-tuning and zero-shot inference scenarios[53]. Self-supervised methods alleviate the need for manual feature engineering, a critical advantage given the high-dimensional nature of fMRI data[51].\n\nIn addition, preprocessing steps play a foundational role in ensuring the robustness of fMRI analyses. Techniques such as motion correction, time-slice correction, and physiological noise removal are essential to mitigate confounds like head movements or artifacts from cardiovascular and respiratory signals[54]. These steps help standardize the data, ensuring that the model learns meaningful patterns rather than noise or spurious correlations. However, despite these preprocessing efforts, fMRI data remain susceptible to confounding factors such as univariate activity or temporal proximity, which can affect interpretability if not accounted for[49].\n\nDeep learning architectures tailored for time-series or image-based data are pivotal for handling the multi-dimensional nature of fMRI signals. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or hybrids of the two, have been employed to process fMRI data effectively for various applications[51]. Additionally, methods like Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) have demonstrated utility in reducing the number of parameters, helping to prevent overfitting and enhancing model robustness, although these methods can be computationally intensive[50]. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) frameworks have also been explored for optimizing the architecture of models handling volumetric task-based fMRI data, underscoring the importance of unsupervised techniques in brain modeling[52].\n\nGeneralization across different tasks and brain regions requires the model to capture shared representations of functional brain networks (FBNs) while being flexible enough to adapt to task-specific dynamics. Functional brain networks represent the organizational architecture of the brain and are critical for understanding the spatial and temporal patterns underlying neural activity[52][56]. Leveraging such representations ensures that the model can generalize across tasks, even when regions of interest or experimental conditions differ.\n\nReal-time analysis is another promising avenue for improving robustness and adaptability. Real-time fMRI has introduced novel possibilities for experimental designs, where immediate feedback can be incorporated to refine the model or the experimental process itself[49][55]. By performing real-time analysis, the model can potentially update its understanding dynamically, accommodating task-specific adjustments on the fly.\n\nDespite these advancements, there are limitations. fMRI data are inherently noisy and reflect a combination of neural, vascular, and physiological processes[56]. The spatial and temporal resolution of fMRI can constrain the precision with which models capture neural dynamics. Furthermore, ambiguity exists in interpreting spontaneous brain activity, especially in resting-state studies, making generalization across tasks more challenging[56]. \n\nIn summary, ensuring BrainLM's effectiveness hinges on a combination of advanced self-supervised learning, meticulous preprocessing, task-adaptable architectures, and leveraging shared representations of functional brain networks. Real-time processing and continual refinement also offer exciting opportunities for improving robustness.

After decades of research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), scientists have proposed a variety of methods for reconstruction of FBNs from fMRI data, such as general linear model (GLM) (Beckmann, Jenkinson et al.",
            "These research studies demonstrated that deep learning models are more powerful on deriving meaningful latent sources (FBNs) from fMRI data, compared to traditional shallow methods. For instances, Zhao et al. used a spatiotemporal deep convolutional neural network (ST-CNN) to model 4D fMRI data (Zhao, Li et al.",
            "Huang et al. used a deep convolutional auto-encoder (DCAE) to model time series fMRI data (Huang, Hu et al. 2018). Wang et al. applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) on volumetric fMRI data (Wang, Zhao et al. 2018). A recent research (Hu, Huang et al. 2018) by our group demonstrated the high performances of RBM in deriving latent sources of fMRI data.",
            "Although there are many undefined FBNs derived by NAS-DBN, our model provided rich information from fMRI data that is important for future research. As a complete data-driven model, it is expected that the NAS-DBN can also work on resting state fMRI data, and provide help for clinical diagnosis by identifying the difference of FBNs derived from patients and healthy subjects. In general, this work contributes an effective unsupervised NAS method on DBN for modeling of volumetric task fMRI data."

To detect neural activations embedded in tfMRI data, various computational and statistical methods have been proposed over the past decades, where the general linear model (GLM) is the most prevailing method for tfMRI analysis (Friston, 2009; Mueller et al., 2013).",

In addition, our framework also identified interpretable and distinctive spatial-temporal components critical for differentiating diverse tfMRI signals, and disclosed the neural implications of these key components.",
            "A relatively under-explored question is whether there exist fundamental differences in fMRI signal composition patterns that can effectively classify the task states of tfMRI data, furthermore, whether there exist key functional components in characterizing the diverse tfMRI signals. Recently, fMRI signal composition patterns of multiple tasks have been investigated via deep learning models, where relatively large populations of fMRI datasets are indispensable and the neurologic meaning of their results is elusive.",

Moreover, our framework cannot only effectively identify the key components that can well characterize and differentiate multitask signals, but also imply the underlying neuroscience implications of these components, offering an effective methodology for basic neuroscience and clinical research. The overall framework (Fig. 1) consists of three stages: (1) data preprocessing and preparation; (2) training stage on training set; (3) classification and pos-hoc analyses stage on testing set. In data preprocessing and preparation, for each subject, the whole-brain fMRI data of seven different tasks were extracted and then spatially concatenated to a matrix"

Since its rise in popularity in the early 1990s, fMRI has been extensively used to measure and map brain activity by imaging changes in blood flow related to energy use by brain cells[10]. It has been applied to study various processes of the mind and brain, as well as the relationship between psychological and neural processes[7]. Doctors use fMRI to understand how the brain functions in normal, diseased, or injured states and to assess potential risks of brain surgery, although its clinical use is primarily approved for surgical planning[5].\n\nIn recent years, the concept of the fMRI brain foundation model has emerged, focusing on translating neuroscience knowledge to the practice of prevention and treatment of neurobehavioral problems[1]. Researchers are exploring the use of fMRI in foundational research to identify emotion-regulatory and cognitive tasks that engage relevant brain areas[9]. This approach also includes the development of brain foundation models capable of adapting to new tasks, predicting anatomical cell types, and understanding neuronal connectivity[2]. As neuroscience collects larger, multi-modal datasets, foundation models are expected to uncover statistical regularities, facilitating rapid adaptation and accelerating research[2]. The Brain Language Model (BrainLM) exemplifies this by using a self-supervised masked-prediction training approach on extensive fMRI recordings, demonstrating its capability in both fine-tuning and zero-shot inference tasks[4].\n\nHowever, fMRI techniques face challenges such as high costs and limited portability, which restrict their application in some prevention efforts[9]. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the need for careful statistical analyses in fMRI research due to the complexity of the data, as a significant number of early studies did not use corrected comparisons, though this has improved over time[3]. Despite these challenges, fMRI continues to play a critical role in advancing our understanding of brain dynamics and supporting the development of foundational models that could transform neuroscience research and its applications[1][8].",

These techniques, which have seen remarkable success in natural language processing, allow models to decode mental states by identifying specific patterns of brain activity associated with emotions like anger or joy[11][13]. The approach is analogous to how models in vision applications learn to recognize visual scenes based on their inherent similarities and differences, without relying on labeled inputs[12][17].\n\nThe ability of brain foundation models like BrainLM to perform tasks such as zero-shot inference is significantly enhanced through self-supervised learning, often surpassing previous fully supervised models[14]. This advancement is particularly beneficial in scientific machine learning applications where the availability of annotated data is limited. Self-supervised training has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in medical applications, such as diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder, demonstrating remarkable improvements in accuracy and efficiency[15].\n\nFurthermore, self-supervised learning mitigates the challenges posed by the requirement for large quantities of labeled data, which is a notable limitation in the training of deep supervised models, especially in medical imaging and brain disease diagnosis[16][18].

One of the key strengths of these models is their ability to predict clinical variables such as age, anxiety, and PTSD, and to forecast future brain states through fine-tuning and zero-shot inference tasks[19]. fMRI, specifically using Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) imaging, has been employed extensively since its inception in 1990 for various clinical applications, including surgical planning, treatment monitoring, and as a biomarker in pharmacologic and training programs[20].\n\nThese foundation models have the potential to transform neurobehavioral treatments by providing insights into brain activity dynamics and enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks[22]. For example, the integration of self-supervised learning and transfer learning into these models may reshape neuroscience research landscapes and enhance the efficacy of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs)[24]. By leveraging these advanced modeling techniques, it becomes feasible to monitor and diagnose disease states more effectively and even facilitate brain-controlled machines and enhanced communication systems[25].\n\nHowever, the high costs and limited portability of fMRI techniques pose challenges to their widespread use in prevention science[23]. To address these limitations, foundational research using fMRI can help identify tasks that reliably engage relevant brain areas, thereby informing targeted interventions. Additionally, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) are contributing to translational efforts aimed at treating neurobehavioral problems, further demonstrating the utility of fMRI brain foundation models in clinical settings[27]. Despite these advancements, there is a pressing need for effective medical foundation models capable of handling various downstream tasks without the reliance on large-scale labeled datasets[21].",

One of the primary challenges is the high dimensionality of fMRI data, which requires extensive time for training deep learning networks and necessitates more efficient learning techniques to accurately interpret brain voxels with minimal misclassification error[31]. Additionally, the slow temporal resolution of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response in fMRI complicates the differentiation of neural activities associated with specific stimuli or tasks when they occur in rapid succession, leading to overlapping signals that pose a significant challenge in cognitive neuroscience research[32].\n\nDespite its high spatial resolution and whole-brain coverage capabilities, fMRI can be cumbersome for subjects due to factors like being confined in a small space, the inability to move, and exposure to excessive noise during scanning. These issues may contribute to the preference for more portable, less invasive, and lower-cost tools in some research scenarios[30]. Moreover, the potential for environmental disturbances, such as lighting conditions and auditory noise, further limits the applications of fMRI in consumer neuroscience[30].\n\nFurthermore, ethical considerations arise due to the wide dissemination and expanding applications of fMRI, prompting discussions about the boundaries of its capabilities and the need for transparent communication to the public[29]. While advancements in real-time fMRI have addressed some limitations of previous EEG-based techniques, challenges remain in achieving efficient learning and accurate interpretation necessary for brain foundation models[28].",

This process is crucial given that most research fMRI studies are conducted by investigators who may not be specialists in reading brain images, raising concerns about unrecognized incidental findings[34]. Such findings, if overlooked, could have significant implications for the participants, emphasizing the importance of appropriate referral and follow-up[33].\n\nInstitutional and research contexts, which vary between sites, also influence the strategies employed to handle incidental findings, thereby affecting the informed consent process[35]. Moreover, recent developments, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR), highlight the evolving nature of consent regulations. For instance, Germany now permits the secondary use of data without consent for scientific research, following a careful assessment of the interests involved[37]. This shift underscores the ongoing balance between advancing scientific research and protecting patient privacy, requiring informed consent processes to be continuously updated and aligned with national and international regulations.

The challenges are further compounded by the expansion of collaborative networks and data sharing initiatives aimed at advancing scientific research[77]. Such initiatives are invaluable for scientific progress but must be navigated carefully to protect individual privacy rights and maintain ethical standards[77].\n\nThe ethical considerations are underscored by datasets like the Mother Of Unification Studies (MOUS) dataset, which includes comprehensive multimodal neuroimaging data from hundreds of subjects, combining structural MRI with functional data obtained during tasks and at rest[79]. Similarly, other datasets involve the acquisition of functional and structural neuroimaging data, including EEG, MEG, and fMRI, during specific tasks, highlighting the complexity and depth of the data collected[78].

Recent legal changes, notably in the EU, have simplified some aspects by granting control back to participants. The most critical elements in this context are obtaining thorough and transparent informed consent and, when appropriate, informed assent. Approval from the local medical ethics committee or institutional review board is mandatory for research studies involving neuroimaging, in line with the Declaration of Helsinki[81].\n\nThe NIH BRAIN Initiative Neuroethics Working Group has prioritized ethical challenges, focusing on risk analysis, informed consent, and post-trial responsibilities[82]. The global scientific community generally adheres to ethical regulations, but variations in legal rules between regions can affect reporting practices. The COVID-19 pandemic further complicated obtaining informed consent due to the risk of infection and resource allocation to clinical rather than research activities[83].\n\nTo protect individuals from informational or discriminatory harm, measures such as forbidding the reidentification of neuroscience data are proposed. For example, the UK's Data Protection Act criminalizes the reidentification of deidentified data without consent, a provision that can be more effective than private data use agreements[84]. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are tasked with evaluating privacy and confidentiality risks in research, ensuring that projects using identifiable data undergo rigorous ethical review.

Each neuroimaging method has its own technical or physiological limitations; however, combining these methods can alleviate such limitations and offer complementary perspectives on neural activity, thereby improving the reconstruction of brain processes[69][72]. Discrepancies between multimodal data can yield novel insights into brain processes and have become a critical component of basic and cognitive neuroscience research, despite the challenges involved in acquiring and combining non-redundant imaging data[70]. The integration of multimodal data enables the visualization and quantitative analysis of brain structure and function alterations, which is crucial for diagnosing neuropsychiatric disorders and advancing neuroscience research[71].\n\nMultimodal neuroimaging setups, such as simultaneous recordings of EEG/MEG with fMRI, have the potential to significantly enhance the spatial resolution of electromagnetic source imaging while enabling the tracing of rapid neural processes and information pathways within the brain, capabilities not achievable with these modalities alone[74]. This approach provides fine spatial and accurate temporal resolution, although real-time integration for applications like Neurofeedback loops poses significant challenges[75]. Such integrative methodologies have reshaped our understanding of the neurovascular coupling and advanced the methodologies for fMRI-EEG/MEG integration, facilitating important discussions and future research directions[73].",

A prominent technique employed is deep learning, which has rapidly become the state-of-the-art for analyzing fMRI datasets, facilitating performance improvements across diverse applications. Deep learning frameworks allow fMRI data to be interpreted as images, time series, or image series, enabling the development of models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or hybrid models for task-specific processing[51][131].\n\nA critical aspect of the model's development is the reduction of feature extraction complexity, which is often achieved using methods like deep belief networks (DBNs). DBNs help in parameter initialization and apply sparse pre-training to mitigate overfitting, although this approach can increase computational time[50]. Additionally, the NAS-DBN framework offers an unsupervised neural architecture search method for modeling volumetric task fMRI data, further enhancing the understanding of functional brain networks (FBNs)[52].\n\nMoreover, incorporating domain-specific knowledge into machine learning models is essential to adaptively capture the complexities of brain activity data, which enhances model robustness and addresses reproducibility challenges in clinical applications[128][129]. This integration is crucial for bridging the gap between machine learning methodologies and human knowledge, highlighting the need for tailored model architectures[130].\n\nThe inclusion of domain knowledge reduces the requirement for extensive feature engineering, leveraging human-machine collaboration to enhance understanding and trustworthiness in academic and translational research[128][132]. Real-time fMRI analysis has also opened novel avenues for training and experimental designs, suggesting significant benefits in obtaining results promptly during data collection rather than post hoc[49]. Together, these strategies form a comprehensive framework for effectively training and applying fMRI brain foundation models.",

The data generated in genomics are often made available to the scientific community, facilitated by collaborations between private and public entities, like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through initiatives such as STRIDES[156]. To safeguard privacy while promoting transparency, a code of conduct is enforced internationally, requiring researchers to prove their institutional status and adhere to ethical standards, thereby granting them access to genomic databases[157]. Furthermore, innovative consent mechanisms, such as dynamic consent, have been introduced by companies to foster robust data-sharing frameworks[158]. The successful data sharing principles that underpinned the Human Genome Project continue to serve as a benchmark, even as challenges to free information sharing persist[159].
