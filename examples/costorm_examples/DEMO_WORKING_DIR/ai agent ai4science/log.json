The next generation of wireless networks is expected to provide scalable, low-latency, ultra-reliable services empowered by the application of data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI). The key enabling technologies of future wireless networks, such as intelligent meta-surfaces, aerial networks, and AI at the edge, involve more than one agent which motivates the importance of multi-agent learning techniques. Furthermore, cooperation is central to establishing self-organizing, self-sustaining, and decentralized networks. In this context, this tutorial focuses on the role of DRL with an emphasis on deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for AI-enabled wireless networks. The first part of this paper will present a clear overview of the mathematical frameworks for single-agent RL and MARL. The main idea of this work is to motivate the application of RL beyond the model-free perspective which was extensively adopted in recent years. Thus, we provide a selective description of RL algorithms such as Model-Based RL (MBRL) and cooperative MARL and we highlight their potential applications in future wireless networks. Finally, we overview the state-of-the-art of MARL in fields such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) networks, and cell-free massive MIMO, and identify promising future research directions. We expect this tutorial to stimulate more research endeavors to build scalable and decentralized systems based on MARL.\n[2]: This article reviews meta-learning also known as learning-to-learn which seeks rapid and accurate model adaptation to unseen tasks with applications in strong AI, few-shot learning, natural language processing and robotics. Unlike deep learning, meta-learning can be applied to few-shot high-dimensional datasets and considers further improving model generalization to unseen tasks. Deep learning is focused upon in-sample prediction and meta-learning concerns model adaptation for out-of-sample prediction. Meta-learning can continually perform self-improvement to achieve highly autonomous AI. Meta-learning may serve as an additional generalization block complementary for original deep learning model. Meta-learning seeks adaptation of machine learning models to unseen tasks which are vastly different from trained tasks. Meta-learning with coevolution between agent and environment provides solutions for complex tasks unsolvable by training from scratch. Meta-learning methodology covers a wide range of great minds and thoughts. We briefly summarize meta-learning methodologies into the following categories: black-box meta-learning, metric-based meta-learning, layered meta-learning and Bayesian meta-learning framework. Recent applications concentrate upon the integration of meta-learning with other machine learning framework to provide feasible integrated problem solutions. We briefly present recent meta-learning advances and discuss potential future research directions.\n[3]: Autonomous agents acting in the real-world often operate based on models that ignore certain aspects of the environment. The incompleteness of any given model – handcrafted or machine acquired – is inevitable due to practical limitations of any modeling technique for complex real-world settings. Due to the limited fidelity of its model, an agent’s actions may have unexpected, undesirable consequences during execution. Learning to recognize and avoid such negative side effects (NSEs) of an agent’s actions is critical to improve the safety and reliability of autonomous systems. Mitigating NSEs is an emerging research topic that is attracting increased attention due to the rapid growth in the deployment of AI systems and their broad societal impacts. This article provides a comprehensive overview of different forms of NSEs and the recent research efforts to address them. We identify key characteristics of NSEs, highlight the challenges in avoiding NSEs, and discuss recently developed approaches, contrasting their benefits and limitations. The article concludes with a discussion of open questions and suggestions for future research directions.\n[4]: In the modern era of technology, Chatbots is the next massive aspect of the generation of conversational services. A chatbot system is a software program that interacts with users using natural language. Chatbots is a virtual individual who can efﬁciently discuss to any human being the usage of interactive textual competencies. Recently, the development of them as a medium of conversation between humans and computers has made a great walk. The motive of a machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence chatbot system is to simulate a human conversation; maybe through text or voice. The chatbot program understands one or more human languages by Natural Language Processing. The chatbot structure integrates a language model and computational algorithms to emulate informal chat communication has covered enormous natural language processing techniques. This paper investigates other applications where chatbots could be useful such as a machine conversation system, virtual agent, dialogue system, information retrieval, business, telecommunication, banking, health, customer call centers, and e-commerce. also gives an overview of cloud-based chatbots technologies along with the programming of chatbots and challenges of programming in current and future Era of the chatbot.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\n\nNow give your response.

However, based on the available insights into AI, I can provide a contextual understanding of how AI agents are impacting scientific domains.\n\nIn recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made substantial progress, offering promising solutions for sequential decision-making problems across various fields, including wireless communications[1]. Such advances hint at the potential for AI agents like AI4Science to play pivotal roles in complex scientific tasks. The concept of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly relevant, as it emphasizes the importance of cooperation among agents, which could be critical in scientific research requiring decentralized and collaborative approaches[1]. \n\nMeta-learning, or learning-to-learn, represents another critical aspect of AI, which aims to enable rapid adaptation to new and unseen tasks[2]. This capability is essential in scientific research, where AI models must often tackle novel problems without extensive retraining. Meta-learning's integration with other machine learning frameworks could further enhance AI4Science's ability to solve complex scientific challenges[2]. \n\nMoreover, the development of autonomous agents that learn to avoid negative side effects (NSEs) is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of AI systems used in scientific research[3]. By addressing NSEs, AI4Science could improve its effectiveness and trustworthiness in real-world applications, where unintended consequences can hinder scientific progress.\n\nLastly, chatbots exemplify how AI can facilitate human-computer interaction, suggesting that similar technologies could be adapted to create interactive scientific assistants. These virtual agents could streamline communication in scientific environments, improving information retrieval and collaboration among researchers[4].\n\nWhile the gathered information does not specifically address AI4Science, these insights provide a framework for understanding how AI agents could be applied in scientific contexts. The potential lies in leveraging advanced AI techniques to enhance research, foster collaboration, and tackle complex scientific problems efficiently.",

We briefly present recent meta-learning advances and discuss potential future research directions.\\n[3]: Autonomous agents acting in the real-world often operate based on models that ignore certain aspects of the environment. The incompleteness of any given model \\u2013 handcrafted or machine acquired \\u2013 is inevitable due to practical limitations of any modeling technique for complex real-world settings. Due to the limited fidelity of its model, an agent\\u2019s actions may have unexpected, undesirable consequences during execution. Learning to recognize and avoid such negative side effects (NSEs) of an agent\\u2019s actions is critical to improve the safety and reliability of autonomous systems. Mitigating NSEs is an emerging research topic that is attracting increased attention due to the rapid growth in the deployment of AI systems and their broad societal impacts. This article provides a comprehensive overview of different forms of NSEs and the recent research efforts to address them. We identify key characteristics of NSEs, highlight the challenges in avoiding NSEs, and discuss recently developed approaches, contrasting their benefits and limitations. The article concludes with a discussion of open questions and suggestions for future research directions.\\n[4]: In the modern era of technology, Chatbots is the next massive aspect of the generation of conversational services. A chatbot system is a software program that interacts with users using natural language. Chatbots is a virtual individual who can ef\\ufb01ciently discuss to any human being the usage of interactive textual competencies. Recently, the development of them as a medium of conversation between humans and computers has made a great walk. The motive of a machine learning and arti\\ufb01cial intelligence chatbot system is to simulate a human conversation; maybe through text or voice. The chatbot program understands one or more human languages by Natural Language Processing. The chatbot structure integrates a language model and computational algorithms to emulate informal chat communication has covered enormous natural language processing techniques. This paper investigates other applications where chatbots could be useful such as a machine conversation system, virtual agent, dialogue system, information retrieval, business, telecommunication, banking, health, customer call centers, and e-commerce. also gives an overview of cloud-based chatbots technologies along with the programming of chatbots and challenges of programming in current and future Era of the chatbot.\\n\\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\\n\\nNow give your response.

Several board characteristics are found to be associated with the extent of Twitter usage as a financial disclosure platform, among which are board independence, gender diversity and board tenure.,The extensive literature examines disclosure via traditional media and its determinants, yet this paper extends the literature by investigating the relatively new disclosure channel of social media. This study is among the first to utilize machine learning, instead of manual coding techniques, to automatically unveil the tweets’ topics and reveal financial disclosure tweets. It is also among the first to investigate the relationships between several board characteristics and financial disclosure on Twitter; providing a distinction between the roles of executive vs non-executive directors relating to disclosure decisions.\n[2]: Student recruitment and retention are important issues for all higher education institutions. Constant monitoring of student satisfaction levels is therefore crucial. Traditionally, students voice their opinions through official surveys organized by the universities. In addition to that, nowadays, social media and review websites such as “Rate my professors” are rich sources of opinions that should not be ignored. Automated mining of students’ opinions can be realized via aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). ABSA s is a sub-discipline of natural language processing (NLP) that focusses on the identification of sentiments (negative, neutral, positive) and aspects (sentiment targets) in a sentence. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a system for ABSA of free text reviews expressed in student opinion surveys in the Serbian language. Sentiment analysis was carried out at the finest level of text granularity – the level of sentence segment (phrase and clause).,The presented system relies on NLP techniques, machine learning models, rules and dictionaries. The corpora collected and annotated for system development and evaluation comprise students’ reviews of teaching staff at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia, and a corpus of publicly available reviews from the Serbian equivalent of the “Rate my professors” website.,The research results indicate that positive sentiment can successfully be identified with the F-measure of 0.83, while negative sentiment can be detected with the F-measure of 0.94. While the F-measure for the aspect’s range is between 0.49 and 0.89, depending on their frequency in the corpus. Furthermore, the authors have concluded that the quality of ABSA depends on the source of the reviews (official students’ surveys vs review websites).,The system for ABSA presented in this paper could improve the quality of service provided by the Serbian higher education institutions through a more effective search and summary of students’ opinions. For example, a particular educational institution could very easily find out which aspects of their service the students are not satisfied with and to which aspects of their service more attention should be directed.,To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study of ABSA carried out at the level of sentence segment for the Serbian language. The methodology and findings presented in this paper provide a much-needed bases for further work on sentiment analysis for the Serbian language that is well under-resourced and under-researched in this area.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\n\nNow give your response.

                "content": "The gathered information provided does not directly relate to the topic of how meta-learning enhances AI agents' ability to adapt to novel scientific tasks compared to traditional machine learning approaches. However, I can provide an insightful response based on general knowledge of the field.\n\nMeta-learning, often referred to as \"learning to learn,\" is a subfield of machine learning where models are trained on a variety of learning tasks with the goal of improving their ability to learn new tasks quickly and efficiently. This contrasts with traditional machine learning, where models are typically trained from scratch for each new task.\n\nIn the context of scientific tasks, meta-learning can significantly enhance AI agents' adaptability for several reasons:\n\n1. **Rapid Adaptation**: Meta-learning models are designed to generalize from previous tasks, allowing them to adapt rapidly to new and unseen tasks with minimal data. This is particularly beneficial in scientific research, where new experiments and scenarios frequently arise, and having a model that can quickly adjust to new data can save valuable time and resources.\n\n2. **Efficient Use of Data**: Scientific tasks often involve limited or expensive data. Meta-learning approaches can leverage previous knowledge, thereby reducing the amount of new data required to achieve effective learning. This contrasts with traditional machine learning models that typically require large datasets to learn effectively.\n\n3. **Transferable Knowledge**: Meta-learning facilitates the transfer of knowledge across different tasks. In scientific domains, where related tasks often share underlying principles, an AI agent can use insights from one task to enhance performance on another, potentially accelerating discoveries and innovations.\n\n4. **Improved Generalization**: By learning to adapt from a distribution of tasks, meta-learning methods can potentially lead to better generalization across a wider array of tasks, which is crucial in the dynamic and varied landscape of scientific research.\n\nWhile the information provided does not delve into meta-learning, the overall principles outlined above reflect the advantages of meta-learning approaches over traditional machine learning in adapting to novel scientific tasks. This adaptability makes meta-learning a promising avenue for developing AI agents that are capable of efficiently tackling the challenges presented in diverse scientific fields.",

Sentiment analysis was carried out at the finest level of text granularity \\u2013 the level of sentence segment (phrase and clause).,The presented system relies on NLP techniques, machine learning models, rules and dictionaries. The corpora collected and annotated for system development and evaluation comprise students\\u2019 reviews of teaching staff at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia, and a corpus of publicly available reviews from the Serbian equivalent of the \\u201cRate my professors\\u201d website.,The research results indicate that positive sentiment can successfully be identified with the F-measure of 0.83, while negative sentiment can be detected with the F-measure of 0.94. While the F-measure for the aspect\\u2019s range is between 0.49 and 0.89, depending on their frequency in the corpus. Furthermore, the authors have concluded that the quality of ABSA depends on the source of the reviews (official students\\u2019 surveys vs review websites).,The system for ABSA presented in this paper could improve the quality of service provided by the Serbian higher education institutions through a more effective search and summary of students\\u2019 opinions. For example, a particular educational institution could very easily find out which aspects of their service the students are not satisfied with and to which aspects of their service more attention should be directed.,To the best of the authors\\u2019 knowledge, this is the first study of ABSA carried out at the level of sentence segment for the Serbian language. The methodology and findings presented in this paper provide a much-needed bases for further work on sentiment analysis for the Serbian language that is well under-resourced and under-researched in this area.\\n\\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\\n\\nNow give your response.

The next generation of wireless networks is expected to provide scalable, low-latency, ultra-reliable services empowered by the application of data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI). The key enabling technologies of future wireless networks, such as intelligent meta-surfaces, aerial networks, and AI at the edge, involve more than one agent which motivates the importance of multi-agent learning techniques. Furthermore, cooperation is central to establishing self-organizing, self-sustaining, and decentralized networks. In this context, this tutorial focuses on the role of DRL with an emphasis on deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for AI-enabled wireless networks. The first part of this paper will present a clear overview of the mathematical frameworks for single-agent RL and MARL. The main idea of this work is to motivate the application of RL beyond the model-free perspective which was extensively adopted in recent years. Thus, we provide a selective description of RL algorithms such as Model-Based RL (MBRL) and cooperative MARL and we highlight their potential applications in future wireless networks. Finally, we overview the state-of-the-art of MARL in fields such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) networks, and cell-free massive MIMO, and identify promising future research directions. We expect this tutorial to stimulate more research endeavors to build scalable and decentralized systems based on MARL. (Question: Background information about ai agent ai4science. Query: AI agent ai4science overview)\n[2]: This article reviews meta-learning also known as learning-to-learn which seeks rapid and accurate model adaptation to unseen tasks with applications in strong AI, few-shot learning, natural language processing and robotics. Unlike deep learning, meta-learning can be applied to few-shot high-dimensional datasets and considers further improving model generalization to unseen tasks. Deep learning is focused upon in-sample prediction and meta-learning concerns model adaptation for out-of-sample prediction. Meta-learning can continually perform self-improvement to achieve highly autonomous AI. Meta-learning may serve as an additional generalization block complementary for original deep learning model. Meta-learning seeks adaptation of machine learning models to unseen tasks which are vastly different from trained tasks. Meta-learning with coevolution between agent and environment provides solutions for complex tasks unsolvable by training from scratch. Meta-learning methodology covers a wide range of great minds and thoughts. We briefly summarize meta-learning methodologies into the following categories: black-box meta-learning, metric-based meta-learning, layered meta-learning and Bayesian meta-learning framework. Recent applications concentrate upon the integration of meta-learning with other machine learning framework to provide feasible integrated problem solutions. We briefly present recent meta-learning advances and discuss potential future research directions. (Question: Background information about ai agent ai4science. Query: AI agent ai4science overview)\n[3]: Autonomous agents acting in the real-world often operate based on models that ignore certain aspects of the environment. The incompleteness of any given model – handcrafted or machine acquired – is inevitable due to practical limitations of any modeling technique for complex real-world settings. Due to the limited fidelity of its model, an agent’s actions may have unexpected, undesirable consequences during execution. Learning to recognize and avoid such negative side effects (NSEs) of an agent’s actions is critical to improve the safety and reliability of autonomous systems. Mitigating NSEs is an emerging research topic that is attracting increased attention due to the rapid growth in the deployment of AI systems and their broad societal impacts. This article provides a comprehensive overview of different forms of NSEs and the recent research efforts to address them. We identify key characteristics of NSEs, highlight the challenges in avoiding NSEs, and discuss recently developed approaches, contrasting their benefits and limitations. The article concludes with a discussion of open questions and suggestions for future research directions. (Question: Background information about ai agent ai4science.

Query: AI agent ai4science overview)\n[2]: This article reviews meta-learning also known as learning-to-learn which seeks rapid and accurate model adaptation to unseen tasks with applications in strong AI, few-shot learning, natural language processing and robotics. Unlike deep learning, meta-learning can be applied to few-shot high-dimensional datasets and considers further improving model generalization to unseen tasks. Deep learning is focused upon in-sample prediction and meta-learning concerns model adaptation for out-of-sample prediction. Meta-learning can continually perform self-improvement to achieve highly autonomous AI. Meta-learning may serve as an additional generalization block complementary for original deep learning model. Meta-learning seeks adaptation of machine learning models to unseen tasks which are vastly different from trained tasks. Meta-learning with coevolution between agent and environment provides solutions for complex tasks unsolvable by training from scratch. Meta-learning methodology covers a wide range of great minds and thoughts. We briefly summarize meta-learning methodologies into the following categories: black-box meta-learning, metric-based meta-learning, layered meta-learning and Bayesian meta-learning framework. Recent applications concentrate upon the integration of meta-learning with other machine learning framework to provide feasible integrated problem solutions. We briefly present recent meta-learning advances and discuss potential future research directions. (Question: Background information about ai agent ai4science. Query: AI agent ai4science overview)\n[3]: Autonomous agents acting in the real-world often operate based on models that ignore certain aspects of the environment. The incompleteness of any given model – handcrafted or machine acquired – is inevitable due to practical limitations of any modeling technique for complex real-world settings.

We identify key characteristics of NSEs, highlight the challenges in avoiding NSEs, and discuss recently developed approaches, contrasting their benefits and limitations.
